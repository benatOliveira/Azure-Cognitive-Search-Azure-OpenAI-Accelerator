    "\n",
    "From the Azure OpenAI documentation ([HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings?tabs=python)), An embedding is a special format of data representation that can be easily utilized by machine learning models and algorithms. The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address the challenge of accommodating context within the token limit of a Language Model (LLM), the solution involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Segmenting Documents**: Divide the documents into smaller segments or chunks.\n",
    "2. **Vectorization of Chunks**: Transform these chunks into vectors using appropriate techniques.\n",
    "3. **Vector Semantic Search**: Execute a semantic search using vectors to identify the top chunks similar to the given question.\n",
    "4. **Optimal Context Provision**: Provide the LLM with the most relevant and concise context, thereby achieving an optimal balance between comprehensiveness and lengthiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that **the documents chunks are already done in Azure Search**. *ordered_content* dictionary (created a few cells above) contains the chunks of each document. So we don't really need to chunk them again, but we still need to make sure that we can be as fast as possible and that we are below the max allowed input token limits of our selected OpenAI model."

    "Our ultimate goal is to rely solely on vector indexes. While it is possible to manually code parsers with OCR for various file types and develop a scheduler to synchronize data with the index, there is a more efficient alternative: **Azure Cognitive Search is soon going to release automated chunking strategies and vectorization within the next months**, so we have three options: \n",
    "1. Wait for this functionality while in the meantime manually push chunks and its vectors to the vector-based indexes \n",
    "2. Fill up the vector-based indexes on-demand, as documents are discovered by users\n",
    "3. Use custom skills (for chunking and vectorization) and use knowledge stores in order to create a vector-base index from a text-based-ai-enriched index at ingestion time. See [HERE](https://github.com/Azure/cognitive-search-vector-pr/blob/main/demo-python/code/azure-search-vector-ingestion-python-sample.ipynb) for instructions on how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to implement Option 2: **Create vector-based indexes per each text-based indexes and fill them up on-demand as documents are discovered**. Why? because is simpler and quick to implement, while we wait for Option 1 to become a feature of Azure Search Engine (which is the automation of Option 3 inside the search engine).\n",
    "\n",
    "As observed in Notebooks 1 and 2, each text-based index contains a field named `vectorized` that we have not utilized yet. We will now harness this field. The objective is to avoid vectorizing all documents at the time of ingestion (Option 3). Instead, we can vectorize the chunks as users search for or discover documents. This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched. This phenomenon mirrors the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) found in nature."

The Plan aims to improve health outcomes for regional, rural \\n\\nand remote NSW residents over the next decade, from 2022 to 2032.  \\n\\nRegional NSW encompasses all regional, rural and remote areas of NSW. There are nine regional local \\n\\nhealth districts in NSW: Central Coast, Far West, Hunter New England, Illawarra Shoalhaven, Mid North \\n\\nCoast, Murrumbidgee, Northern NSW, Southern NSW and Western NSW. Some areas of other local health \\n\\ndistricts may also be considered regional for the purpose of the plan such as South Western Sydney and \\n\\nNepean Blue Mountains. The Regional Health Strategic Plan is also supported by the metropolitan local \\n\\nhealth districts and by the Specialty Health Networks which have patients in many regional locations. \\n\\nThe Regional Health Plan Priority Framework outlines a suite of targets for each Strategic Priority, to be \\n\\nachieved in the first time horizon of the Plan (years 1-3). \\n\\nPRIORITIES KEY OBJECTIVES \\n\\n \\n\\n1. Strengthen the regional health workforce: \\nBuild our regional workforce; provide career \\npathways for people to train and stay in the \\nregions; attract and retain healthcare staff; \\naddress culture and psychological safety, physical \\nsafety and racism in the workplace. \\n\\n1.1 Invest in and promote rural generalism for allied health professionals, nurses and doctors \\n\\n1.2 Prioritise the attraction and retention of healthcare professionals and non-clinical staff in \\nregional NSW \\n\\n1.3 Tailor and support career pathways for Aboriginal health staff with a focus on \\nrecruitment and retention \\n\\n1.4 Expand training and upskilling opportunities, including across borders to build a pipeline \\nof regionally based workers \\n\\n1.5 Accelerate changes to scope of practice whilst maintaining quality and safety, \\nencouraging innovative workforce models and recognition of staff experience and skills \\n\\n1.6 Nurture culture, psychological and physical safety in all NSW Health workplaces and \\nbuild positive work environments that allow staff to thrive \\n\\n \\n\\n2.

Legislation, governance and performance framework \\n\\n2.1 Legislation \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, \\n\\nincluding setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss. 8, 9, 10). \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, \\n\\noversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as \\n\\nwell as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient \\n\\nand economic operation of the public health system (s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts \\n\\nin relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance \\n\\nagreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy, all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for \\n\\nthose purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n2.2 Variation of the agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and \\n\\nthe Ministry of Health. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in the exercise of their general \\n\\npowers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health \\n\\nDistricts (s. 32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be \\n\\nprovided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry of Health in the course of \\n\\nthe year. \\n\\n2.3 National Agreement \\n\\nThe National Cabinet has reaffirmed that providing universal healthcare for all Australians is a shared \\n\\npriority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2020 to 30 June \\n\\n2025. That Agreement maintains activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus \\n\\non improved patient safety, quality of services and reduce unnecessary hospitalisations.

The availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, \\n\\nand whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event also influences the \\n\\nassessment. \\n\\nThe Framework sets out responses to performance concerns and management processes that support \\n\\nthe achievement of outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. \\n\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance \\n\\nreview meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at: \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nStrategic and local priorities \\n\\n2021–22 Service Agreement         7 \\n\\n3. Strategic and local priorities \\n\\nThe delivery of NSW Health strategies and priorities is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, \\n\\nhealth services and support organisations. These are to be reflected in the strategic, operational and \\n\\nbusiness plans of these entities. \\n\\n3.1 NSW Premier’s Priorities  \\n\\nIn June 2019, the NSW Premier set new social priorities to tackle tough community challenges, lift the \\n\\nquality of life for everyone in NSW and put people at the heart of everything the Government does.  \\n\\nNSW Health is leading the three priorities for improving the health system:  \\n\\n• Improving outpatient and community care  \\n\\nReduce preventable hospital visits by 5% through to 2023 by caring for people in the community. \\n\\n• Improving service levels in hospitals \\n\\n100% of all triage category 1, 95% of triage category 2, and 85% of triage category 3 patients \\n\\ncommencing treatment on time by 2023 \\n\\n• Towards zero suicides \\n\\nReduce the rate of suicide deaths in NSW by 20% by 2023 \\n\\nNSW Health staff will continue to work together to deliver a sustainable health system that delivers \\n\\noutcomes that matter to patients and the community, is personalised, invests in wellness and is \\n\\ndigitally enabled. \\n\\n3.2 NSW Health Outcome and Business Plan \\n\\nThe NSW Treasury Outcome Budgeting initiative intends to transform the way budget decisions are \\n\\nmade, and resources are managed in the NSW public sector. The overarching objective of Outcome \\n\\nBudgeting is to shift the focus of the NSW Government to deliver better outcomes for the people of \\n\\nNSW with increased transparency, accountability and value (TPP 18-09 – available at \\n\\nhttps://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/2018-12/TPP18-\\n\\n09%20Outcome%20Budgeting.pdf). \\n\\nThe NSW Health Outcome and Business Plan is an agreement between the Minister for Health and \\n\\nMedical Research, the Secretary, NSW Health and the NSW Government setting out the outcomes and \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'objectives that will be the focus for the current period. \\n\\nNSW Health has identified five state outcomes that it will achieve for the people of NSW. The state \\n\\noutcomes cover the broad range of functions and services provided across care settings. \\n\\n1. Keeping people healthy through prevention and health promotion  \\n\\n2. People can access care in out of hospital settings to manage their health and wellbeing  \\n\\n3. People receive timely emergency care  \\n\\n4. People receive high-quality, safe care in our hospitals  \\n\\n5. Our people and systems are continuously improving to deliver the best health outcomes and \\n\\nexperiences  \\n\\nTo achieve these outcomes, NSW Health has set a series of ambitious targets and has a comprehensive \\n\\nprogram of change initiatives in place. These targets have been built into key performance indicators \\n\\nin the Service Agreement, the NSW Health Performance Framework, the NSW Health Purchasing \\n\\nFramework and the funding model.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nStrategic and local priorities \\n\\n2021–22 Service Agreement         8 \\n\\n3.3 Local priorities \\n\\nUnder the Health Services Act 1997, Boards have the function of ensuring that Districts and Networks \\n\\ndevelop strategic plans to guide the delivery of services, and for approving these plans.  \\n\\nThe Organisation is responsible for developing the following plans with Board oversight: \\n\\n• Strategic Plan \\n\\n• Clinical Services Plans \\n\\n• Safety and Quality Account and subsequent Safety and Quality Plan \\n\\n• Workforce Plan \\n\\n• Corporate Governance Plan \\n\\n• Asset Strategic Plan \\n\\nIt is recognised that the Organisation will implement local priorities to meet the needs of their \\n\\nrespective populations.  \\n\\nThe Organisation’s local priorities for 2021-2022 are as follows: \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nStrategic and local priorities \\n\\n2021–22 Service Agreement         9 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n UR PEOPLE Health OUR PLACE NSW Western Sydney GOVERNMENT Local Health District Strategic Priorities We aim to be a trusted partner of our community, delivering modern healthcare.

Legislation, governance and performance framework \\n\\n2.1 Legislation \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, \\n\\nincluding setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss. 8, 9, 10). \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, \\n\\noversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as \\n\\nwell as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient \\n\\nand economic operation of the public health system (s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts \\n\\nin relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance \\n\\nagreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127).

The overarching objective of Outcome \\n\\nBudgeting is to shift the focus of the NSW Government to deliver better outcomes for the people of \\n\\nNSW with increased transparency, accountability and value (TPP 18-09 – available at \\n\\nhttps://www.treasury.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/files/2018-12/TPP18-\\n\\n09%20Outcome%20Budgeting.pdf). \\n\\nThe NSW Health Outcome and Business Plan is an agreement between the Minister for Health and \\n\\nMedical Research, the Secretary, NSW Health and the NSW Government setting out the outcomes and \\n\\n',\n",

The performance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement.\\nUnder the Act, the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any subsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy, all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary.\\n2.2 Variation of the agreement\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and the Ministry of Health.\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in the exercise of their general powers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health Districts (s. 32).\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry of Health in the course of the year.\\n2.3 National Agreement\\nThe National Cabinet has reaffirmed that providing universal healthcare for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025. That Agreement maintains activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus on improved patient safety, quality of services and reduce unnecessary hospitalisations. The Commonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.\\nLegislation, governance and performance framework 2021–22 Service Agreement\\n2.4 Governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, obligations and accountabilities are understood and complied with, and that services are provided in a manner consistent with all NSW Health policies, procedures, plans, circulars, inter-agency agreements, Ministerial directives and other instruments and statutory obligations.\\n2.4.1 Clinical governance\\nNSW public health services are accredited against the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards.\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/nsqhs-standards- second-edition/\\nThe Australian Safety and Quality Framework for Health Care provides a set of guiding principles that can assist health services with their clinical governance obligations.\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/publications-and-resources/resource-library/australian-safety- and-quality-framework-health-care\\nThe NSW Patient Safety and Clinical Quality Program provides an important framework for improvements to clinical quality.\\n',\n",

The availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event also influences the assessment.\\nThe Framework sets out responses to performance concerns and management processes that support the achievement of outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. Performance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance review meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n3.

Objectives of the Service Agreement \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To articulate responsibilities and accountabilities across all NSW Health entities for the \\n\\ndelivery of the priorities of the NSW Government and NSW Health. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To establish with Districts and Networks a performance management and accountability \\n\\nsystem for the delivery of high quality, effective health care services that promote, protect \\n\\nand maintain the health of the community, and provide care and treatment to sick and \\n\\ninjured people, taking into account the particular needs of their diverse communities. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To develop effective partnerships with Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services \\n\\nand ensure the health needs of Aboriginal people are considered in all health plans and \\n\\nprograms developed by Districts and Networks. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To promote accountability to Government and the community for service delivery and \\n\\nfunding.  \\n\\n2. CORE Values \\n\\nAchieving the goals, directions and strategies for NSW Health requires clear and co-ordinated \\n\\nprioritisation of work programs, and supportive leadership that exemplifies the CORE Values \\n\\nof NSW Health:   \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Collaboration – we are committed to working collaboratively with each other to achieve the \\n\\nbest possible outcomes for our patients who are at the centre of everything we do.  In \\n\\nworking collaboratively we acknowledge that every person working in the health system \\n\\nplays a valuable role that contributes to achieving the best possible outcomes. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Openness – a commitment to openness in our communications builds confidence and \\n\\ngreater cooperation.  We are committed to encouraging our patients, and all people who \\n\\nwork in the health system, to provide feedback that will help us provide better services. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Respect – we have respect for the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements of all \\n\\npeople who work in the health system.  We are also committed to providing health services \\n\\nthat acknowledge and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients and their \\n\\ncarers. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Empowerment – in providing quality health care services we aim to ensure our patients \\n\\nare able to make well informed and confident decisions about their care and treatment.  \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'We further aim to create a sense of empowerment in the workplace for people to use their \\n\\nknowledge, skills and experience to provide the best possible care to patients, their \\n\\nfamilies and carers.   \\n\\n3. Culture, Community and Workforce Engagement  \\n\\nDistricts and Networks are to ensure appropriate consultation and engagement with patients, \\n\\ncarers and communities in relation to the design and delivery of health services.  Impact \\n\\nStatements are to be considered and, where relevant, incorporated into health policies. \\n\\nConsistent with the principles of accountability and stakeholder consultation, the engagement \\n\\nof clinical staff in key decisions, such as resource allocation and service planning, is crucial to \\n\\nthe achievement of local priorities. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n \\n\\nEngagement Surveys \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The People Matter Employee Survey measures the experiences of individuals across the \\n\\nNSW Health system in working with their team, managers and the organisation.  The \\n\\nresults of the survey will be used to identify areas of both best practice and improvement \\n\\nopportunities, to determine how change can be affected at an individual, organisational \\n\\nand system level to improve workplace culture and practices.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Junior Medical Officer Your Training and Wellbeing Matters Survey will monitor the \\n\\nquality of supervision, education and training provided to junior medical officers and their \\n\\nwelfare and wellbeing. The survey will also identify areas of best practice and further \\n\\nopportunities for improvement at an organisational and system level. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Australian Medical Association, in conjunction with the Australian Salaried Medical \\n\\nOfficers Association, will be undertaking regular surveys of senior medical staff to assess \\n\\nclinical participation and involvement in local decision making to deliver patient centred \\n\\ncare. \\n\\n4. Legislation, Governance and Performance Framework \\n\\n4.1 Legislation  \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health \\n\\nsystem, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss \\n\\n8, 9, 10).       \\n\\nUnder the Act the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of \\n\\ngovernance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health \\n\\norganisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health \\n\\nsystem, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system \\n\\n(s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health \\n\\nDistricts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The \\n\\nperformance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127).  As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be \\n\\nused for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n4.2 Variation of the Agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the \\n\\nOrganisation and the Ministry. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general \\n\\npowers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local \\n\\nHealth Districts (s. 32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement \\n\\nwill be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry in the course \\n\\nof the year. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n\\n4.3 National Agreement - Hospital funding and health reform \\n\\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has reaffirmed that providing universal health \\n\\ncare for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public \\n\\nhospitals funding from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020.  That Agreement preserves important \\n\\nparts of the existing system, including activity based funding and the national efficient price.  \\n\\nThere is a focus on actions to improve patient safety and the quality of services and reduce \\n\\nunnecessary hospitalisations.  The Commonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in \\n\\nprimary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable hospital \\n\\nadmissions.  See http://www.coag.gov.au/agreements  \\n\\n4.4 Governance \\n\\nEach Health Service and Support Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, \\n\\nobligations and accountabilities are understood and complied with, and that services are \\n\\nprovided in a manner consistent with all NSW Health policies, procedures plans, circulars, \\n\\ninter-agency agreements, Ministerial directives and other instruments and statutory \\n\\nobligations. \\n\\nDistricts and Networks are to ensure \\n\\n',\n",

Standard 1 ensures that everyone – from frontline clinicians to managers and \\n\\nmembers of governing bodies, such as boards – are accountable to patients and the \\n\\ncommunity for assuring the delivery of health services that are safe, effective, integrated, high \\n\\nquality and continuously improving.  \\n\\nDistricts and Networks complete Safety and Quality Accounts to document achievements, and \\n\\naffirm an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their \\n\\nfunctions.  The Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by \\n\\nthe Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory and locally selected high priority \\n\\nmeasures, patient safety priorities, service improvements and integration initiatives.  The \\n\\nAccount must also demonstrate how the Organisation meets Standard 1.    \\n\\nConsistent with the National Agreement, Districts and Networks must continue to focus on \\n\\nreducing the incidence of Hospital Acquired Complications.  Through the Purchasing \\n\\nFramework, NSW Health has incentivised Districts and Networks to locally invest in quality \\n\\nimprovement initiatives to specifically target these complications.  It is expected that the Safety \\n\\nand Quality account articulates the incentivised initiative/s, and provides details on the \\n\\napproach and outcomes.   \\n\\n4.4.4   Performance Framework \\n\\nService Agreements are central components of the NSW Health Performance Framework, \\n\\nwhich documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector \\n\\nhealth services to achieve the expected service levels, financial performance, governance and \\n\\nother requirements. \\n\\nThe performance of a Health Service is assessed in terms of whether the organisation is \\n\\nmeeting the strategic objectives for NSW Health and Government, the Premier’s priorities, the \\n\\navailability and implementation of governance structures and processes, performance against \\n\\ntargets and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event. \\n\\nThe Framework also sets out the performance improvement approaches, responses to \\n\\nperformance concerns and management processes that support achievement of these \\n\\n',\n",

To do this, Health Services are to continue to effectively engage with the \\n\\ncommunity, and ensure that managers at all levels are visible and working collaboratively \\n\\nwith staff, patients and carers within their organisation, service or unit.

Objectives of the Service Agreement \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To articulate responsibilities and accountabilities across all NSW Health entities for the \\n\\ndelivery of the priorities of the NSW Government and NSW Health. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To establish with Districts and Networks a performance management and accountability \\n\\nsystem for the delivery of high quality, effective health care services that promote, protect \\n\\nand maintain the health of the community, and provide care and treatment to sick and \\n\\ninjured people, taking into account the particular needs of their diverse communities. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To develop effective partnerships with Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services \\n\\nand ensure the health needs of Aboriginal people are considered in all health plans and \\n\\nprograms developed by Districts and Networks. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 To promote accountability to Government and the community for service delivery and \\n\\nfunding.  \\n\\n2. CORE Values \\n\\nAchieving the goals, directions and strategies for NSW Health requires clear and co-ordinated \\n\\nprioritisation of work programs, and supportive leadership that exemplifies the CORE Values \\n\\nof NSW Health:   \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Collaboration – we are committed to working collaboratively with each other to achieve the \\n\\nbest possible outcomes for our patients who are at the centre of everything we do.  In \\n\\nworking collaboratively we acknowledge that every person working in the health system \\n\\nplays a valuable role that contributes to achieving the best possible outcomes. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Openness – a commitment to openness in our communications builds confidence and \\n\\ngreater cooperation.  We are committed to encouraging our patients, and all people who \\n\\nwork in the health system, to provide feedback that will help us provide better services. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Respect – we have respect for the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements of all \\n\\npeople who work in the health system.  We are also committed to providing health services \\n\\nthat acknowledge and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients and their \\n\\ncarers. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Empowerment – in providing quality health care services we aim to ensure our patients \\n\\nare able to make well informed and confident decisions about their care and treatment.  \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'We further aim to create a sense of empowerment in the workplace for people to use their \\n\\nknowledge, skills and experience to provide the best possible care to patients, their \\n\\nfamilies and carers.   \\n\\n3. Culture, Community and Workforce Engagement  \\n\\nDistricts and Networks are to ensure appropriate consultation and engagement with patients, \\n\\ncarers and communities in relation to the design and delivery of health services.  Impact \\n\\nStatements are to be considered and, where relevant, incorporated into health policies. \\n\\nConsistent with the principles of accountability and stakeholder consultation, the engagement \\n\\nof clinical staff in key decisions, such as resource allocation and service planning, is crucial to \\n\\nthe achievement of local priorities. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n \\n\\nEngagement Surveys \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The People Matter Employee Survey measures the experiences of individuals across the \\n\\nNSW Health system in working with their team, managers and the organisation.  The \\n\\nresults of the survey will be used to identify areas of both best practice and improvement \\n\\nopportunities, to determine how change can be affected at an individual, organisational \\n\\nand system level to improve workplace culture and practices.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Junior Medical Officer Your Training and Wellbeing Matters Survey will monitor the \\n\\nquality of supervision, education and training provided to junior medical officers and their \\n\\nwelfare and wellbeing.

Legislation, Governance and Performance Framework \\n\\n4.1 Legislation  \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health \\n\\nsystem, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss \\n\\n8, 9, 10).       \\n\\nUnder the Act the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of \\n\\ngovernance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health \\n\\norganisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health \\n\\nsystem, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system \\n\\n(s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health \\n\\nDistricts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The \\n\\nperformance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127).  As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be \\n\\nused for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n4.2 Variation of the Agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the \\n\\nOrganisation and the Ministry. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general \\n\\npowers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local \\n\\nHealth Districts (s. 32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement \\n\\nwill be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry in the course \\n\\nof the year. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n \\n\\n4.3 National Agreement - Hospital funding and health reform \\n\\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has reaffirmed that providing universal health \\n\\ncare for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public \\n\\nhospitals funding from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020.  That Agreement preserves important \\n\\nparts of the existing system, including activity based funding and the national efficient price.  \\n\\nThere is a focus on actions to improve patient safety and the quality of services and reduce \\n\\nunnecessary hospitalisations.  The Commonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in \\n\\nprimary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable hospital \\n\\nadmissions.  See http://www.coag.gov.au/agreements  \\n\\n4.4 Governance \\n\\nEach Health Service and Support Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, \\n\\nobligations and accountabilities are understood and complied with, and that services are \\n\\nprovided in a manner consistent with all NSW Health policies, procedures plans, circulars, \\n\\ninter-agency agreements, Ministerial directives and other instruments and statutory \\n\\nobligations. \\n\\nDistricts and Networks are to ensure \\n\\n',\n",

Standard 1 ensures that everyone – from frontline clinicians to managers and \\n\\nmembers of governing bodies, such as boards – are accountable to patients and the \\n\\ncommunity for assuring the delivery of health services that are safe, effective, integrated, high \\n\\nquality and continuously improving.  \\n\\nDistricts and Networks complete Safety and Quality Accounts to document achievements, and \\n\\naffirm an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their \\n\\nfunctions.  The Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by \\n\\nthe Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory and locally selected high priority \\n\\nmeasures, patient safety priorities, service improvements and integration initiatives.  The \\n\\nAccount must also demonstrate how the Organisation meets Standard 1.    \\n\\nConsistent with the National Agreement, Districts and Networks must continue to focus on \\n\\nreducing the incidence of Hospital Acquired Complications.  Through the Purchasing \\n\\nFramework, NSW Health has incentivised Districts and Networks to locally invest in quality \\n\\nimprovement initiatives to specifically target these complications.  It is expected that the Safety \\n\\nand Quality account articulates the incentivised initiative/s, and provides details on the \\n\\napproach and outcomes.   \\n\\n4.4.4   Performance Framework \\n\\nService Agreements are central components of the NSW Health Performance Framework, \\n\\nwhich documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector \\n\\nhealth services to achieve the expected service levels, financial performance, governance and \\n\\nother requirements. \\n\\nThe performance of a Health Service is assessed in terms of whether the organisation is \\n\\nmeeting the strategic objectives for NSW Health and Government, the Premier’s priorities, the \\n\\navailability and implementation of governance structures and processes, performance against \\n\\ntargets and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event. \\n\\nThe Framework also sets out the performance improvement approaches, responses to \\n\\nperformance concerns and management processes that support achievement of these \\n\\n',\n",

To do this, Health Services are to continue to effectively engage with the \\n\\ncommunity, and ensure that managers at all levels are visible and working collaboratively \\n\\nwith staff, patients and carers within their organisation, service or unit.

Objectives of the Service Agreement\\n: To articulate responsibilities and accountabilities across all NSW Health entities for the delivery of the priorities of the NSW Government and NSW Health.\\nTo establish with Districts and Networks a performance management and accountability system for the delivery of high quality, effective health care services that promote, protect and maintain the health of the community, and provide care and treatment to sick and injured people, taking into account the particular needs of their diverse communities.\\nTo develop effective partnerships with Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services and ensure the health needs of Aboriginal people are considered in all health plans and programs developed by Districts and Networks.\\nTo promote accountability to Government and the community for service delivery and funding.\\n2. CORE Values\\nAchieving the goals, directions and strategies for NSW Health requires clear and co-ordinated prioritisation of work programs, and supportive leadership that exemplifies the CORE Values of NSW Health:\\nCollaboration – we are committed to working collaboratively with each other to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients who are at the centre of everything we do. In working collaboratively we acknowledge that every person working in the health system plays a valuable role that contributes to achieving the best possible outcomes.\\nOpenness – a commitment to openness in our communications builds confidence and greater cooperation. We are committed to encouraging our patients, and all people who work in the health system, to provide feedback that will help us provide better services.\\nRespect – we have respect for the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements of all people who work in the health system. We are also committed to providing health services that acknowledge and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients and their carers.\\nEmpowerment – in providing quality health care services we aim to ensure our patients are able to make well informed and confident decisions about their care and treatment. We further aim to create a sense of empowerment in the workplace for people to use their knowledge, skills and experience to provide the best possible care to patients, their families and carers.\\n3. Culture, Community and Workforce Engagement\\n',\n",

The results of the survey will be used to identify areas of both best practice and improvement opportunities, to determine how change can be affected at an individual, organisational and system level to improve workplace culture and practices.\\nThe Junior Medical Officer Your Training and Wellbeing Matters Survey will monitor the quality of supervision, education and training provided to junior medical officers and their welfare and wellbeing. The survey will also identify areas of best practice and further opportunities for improvement at an organisational and system level.\\nThe Australian Medical Association, in conjunction with the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Association, will be undertaking regular surveys of senior medical staff to assess clinical participation and involvement in local decision making to deliver patient centred care.\\n4. Legislation, Governance and Performance Framework\\n4.1 Legislation\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss 8, 9, 10).\\nUnder the Act the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and maintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system (s.122).\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement.\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any subsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary.\\n4.2 Variation of the Agreement\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and the Ministry.\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general powers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health Districts (s. 32).\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry in the course of the year.\\n4.3 National Agreement - Hospital funding and health reform\\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has reaffirmed that providing universal health care for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020. That Agreement preserves important parts of the existing system, including activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus on actions to improve patient safety and the quality of services and reduce unnecessary hospitalisations. ',\n",
       "                'The Commonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable hospital admissions. See http://www.coag.gov.au/agreements\\n4.4 Governance\\nEach Health Service and Support Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, obligations and accountabilities are understood and complied with, and that services are provided in a manner consistent with all NSW Health policies, procedures plans, circulars, inter-agency agreements, Ministerial directives and other instruments and statutory obligations.\\nDistricts and Networks are to ensure\\nTimely implementation of Coroner’s findings and recommendations, as well as recommendations of Root Cause Analyses.\\nActive participation in state-wide reviews.\\n4.4.1 Clinical Governance\\nNSW public health services are accredited against the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards.\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/nsqhs- standards-second-edition/\\nThe Australian Safety and Quality Framework for Health Care provides a set of guiding principles that can assist Health Services with their clinical governance obligations. See http://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Australian-SandQ- Framework1.pdf\\nThe NSW Patient Safety and Clinical Quality Program provides an important framework for improvements to clinical quality.\\nhttp://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/ActivePDSDocuments/PD2005_608.pdf\\n4.4.2 Corporate Governance\\nEach Health Service and Support Organisation must ensure services are delivered in a manner consistent with the NSW Health Corporate Governance and Accountability Compendium (the Compendium) seven corporate governance standards. The Compendium is at: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/manuals/pages/corporate-governance-\\ncompendium.aspx\\nWhere applicable, they are to:\\nProvide required reports in accordance with the timeframes advised by the Ministry;\\n. Review and update Manual of Delegations (PD2012_059) to ensure currency;\\n. Ensure NSW Auditor-General’s, the Public Accounts Committee and the NSW Ombudsman’s recommendations where accepted by NSW Health are actioned in a timely and effective manner, and that repeat audit issues are avoided.\\n\\n4.4.3 Safety and Quality Accounts\\nStandard 1, Clinical Governance, of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards describes the clinical governance, and safety and quality systems that are required to maintain and improve the reliability, safety and quality of health care, and improve health outcomes for patients. Standard 1 ensures that everyone – from frontline clinicians to managers and members of governing bodies, such as boards – are accountable to patients and the community for assuring the delivery of health services that are safe, effective, integrated, high quality and continuously improving.\\nDistricts and Networks complete Safety and Quality Accounts to document achievements, and affirm an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their functions. The Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by the Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory and locally selected high priority measures, patient safety priorities, service improvements and integration initiatives. The Account must also demonstrate how the Organisation meets Standard 1.\\nConsistent with the National Agreement, Districts and Networks must continue to focus on reducing the incidence of Hospital Acquired Complications. Through the Purchasing Framework, NSW Health has incentivised Districts and Networks to locally invest in quality improvement initiatives to specifically target these complications. It is expected that the Safety and Quality account articulates the incentivised initiative/s, and provides details on the approach and outcomes.\\n4.4.4 Performance Framework\\nService Agreements are central components of the NSW Health Performance Framework, which documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector health services to achieve the expected service levels, financial performance, governance and other requirements.\\nThe performance of a Health Service is assessed in terms of whether the organisation is meeting the strategic objectives for NSW Health and Government, the Premier’s priorities, the availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, performance against targets and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event.\\nThe Framework also sets out the performance improvement approaches, responses to performance concerns and management processes that support achievement of these outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and Government policy and priorities.\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance review meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at:\\n',\n",

Delivery of the Strategies and Priorities is the mutual responsibility of all entities.\\nNSW: Making it Happen\\nNSW: Making it Happen outlines NSW Health’s State Priorities, including 12 Premier’s Priorities that together define the NSW Government’s vision for a stronger, healthier and safer NSW. As delivery of both Premier’s and State priorities is the responsibility of all NSW Government Agencies, all entities work together to ensure successful delivery, in both lead and partnering agency capacities.\\nElection Commitments\\nNSW Health is responsible for the delivery of 102 election commitments over the period to March 2019. The Ministry of Health will lead the delivery of these commitments with support from Health Services and Support Organisations – see also http://nswtreasury.prod.acquia-sites.com/sites/default/files/pdf/2015-2016_Budget_Papers_-\\n_Election_Commitments_2015-19.pdf\\nMinister’s Priority\\nNSW Health will strive for engagement, empathy and excellence to promote a positive and compassionate culture that is shared by managers, front-line clinical and support staff alike. This culture will ensure the delivery of safe, appropriate, high quality care for our patients and communities. To do this, Health Services are to continue to effectively engage with the community, and ensure that managers at all levels are visible and working collaboratively with staff, patients and carers within their organisation, service or unit.

In \\n\\nworking collaboratively we acknowledge that every person working in the health system \\n\\nplays a valuable role that contributes to achieving the best possible outcomes. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Openness – a commitment to openness in our communications builds confidence and \\n\\ngreater cooperation.  We are committed to encouraging our patients, and all people who \\n\\nwork in the health system, to provide feedback that will help us provide better services. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Respect – we have respect for the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements of all \\n\\npeople who work in the health system.  We are also committed to providing health services \\n\\nthat acknowledge and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients and their \\n\\ncarers. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Empowerment – in providing quality health care services we aim to ensure our patients \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'are able to make well informed and confident decisions about their care and treatment.  \\n\\nWe further aim to create a sense of empowerment in the workplace for people to use their \\n\\nknowledge, skills and experience to provide the best possible care to patients, their \\n\\nfamilies and carers.  \\n\\n3. Culture, Community and Workforce Engagement  \\n\\nThe Organisation must ensure appropriate consultation and engagement with patients, carers \\n\\nand communities in the design and delivery of health services. Impact Statements, including \\n\\nAboriginal Health Impact Statements, are to be considered and, where relevant, incorporated \\n\\ninto health policies. Consistent with the principles of accountability and stakeholder \\n\\nconsultation, the engagement of clinical staff in key decisions, such as resource allocation and \\n\\nservice planning, is crucial to the achievement of local priorities. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n3.1 Engagement Surveys \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The People Matter Employee Survey measures the experiences of individuals across the \\n\\nNSW Health system in working with their team, managers and the organisation. The \\n\\nresults of the survey will be used to identify areas of both best practice and improvement \\n\\nopportunities, to determine how change can be affected at an individual, organisational \\n\\nand system level to improve workplace culture and practices.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Junior Medical Officer Your Training and Wellbeing Matters Survey will monitor the \\n\\nquality of supervision, education and training provided to junior medical officers and their \\n\\nwelfare and wellbeing. The survey will also identify areas of best practice and further \\n\\nopportunities for improvement at an organisational and system level. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Australian Medical Association, in conjunction with the Australian Salaried Medical \\n\\nOfficers Association, will undertake regular surveys of senior medical staff to assess \\n\\nclinical participation and involvement in local decision making to deliver patient centred \\n\\ncare. \\n\\n4. Legislation, Governance and Performance Framework \\n\\n4.1 Legislation  \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health \\n\\nsystem, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss \\n\\n8, 9, 10). \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of \\n\\ngovernance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health \\n\\norganisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health \\n\\nsystem, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system \\n\\n(s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health \\n\\nDistricts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The \\n\\nperformance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be \\n\\nused for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n4.2 Variation of the Agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the \\n\\nOrganisation and the Ministry. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general \\n\\npowers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local \\n\\nHealth Districts (s. 32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement \\n\\nwill be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry in the course \\n\\nof the year. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\n4.3 National Agreement - Hospital funding and health reform \\n\\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has reaffirmed that providing universal health \\n\\ncare for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public \\n\\nhospitals funding from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020. That Agreement maintains activity based \\n\\nfunding and the national efficient price. There is a focus on improved patient safety, quality of \\n\\nservices and reduced unnecessary hospitalisations. The Commonwealth will continue its focus \\n\\non reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce \\n\\navoidable hospital admissions. See http://www.coag.gov.au/agreements  \\n\\n4.4 Governance \\n\\nThe Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, obligations and accountabilities are \\n\\nunderstood and complied with, and that services are provided in a manner consistent with all \\n\\nNSW Health policies, procedures, plans, circulars, inter-agency agreements, Ministerial \\n\\ndirectives and other instruments and statutory obligations. \\n\\nThe Organisation is to ensure \\n\\n',\n",

The Compendium is at: \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/manuals/pages/corporate-governance-\\n\\ncompendium.aspx \\n\\nWhere applicable, the Organisation is to:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Provide required reports in accordance with timeframes advised by the Ministry; \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Review and update the Manual of Delegations (PD2012_059) to ensure currency; \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Ensure recommendations of the NSW Auditor-General, the Public Accounts Committee \\n\\nand the NSW Ombudsman, where accepted by NSW Health, are actioned in a timely and \\n\\neffective manner, and that repeat audit issues are avoided. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.coag.gov.au/agreements\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/nsqhs-standards-second-edition/\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/nsqhs-standards-second-edition/\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/national-priorities/australian-safety-and-quality-framework-for-health-care/\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/national-priorities/australian-safety-and-quality-framework-for-health-care/\\nhttp://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/ActivePDSDocuments/PD2005_608.pdf\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/manuals/pages/corporate-governance-compendium.aspx\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/manuals/pages/corporate-governance-compendium.aspx\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n6 \\n\\n4.4.3 Procurement Governance  \\n\\nThe Organisation must ensure procurement of goods and services complies with the NSW \\n\\nHealth Procurement Policy, the key policy governing procurement practices for all NSW \\n\\nHealth organisations. The NSW Health Procurement Policy is to be applied in conjunction with \\n\\nprocedures detailed in the NSW Health Goods and Services Procurement Policy Directive \\n\\n(PD2018_030). These documents detail the requirements of all staff undertaking procurement \\n\\nor disposal of goods and services on behalf of NSW Health.  \\n\\nhttps://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/Pages/doc.aspx?dn=PD2018_030 \\n\\n4.4.4 Safety and Quality Accounts \\n\\nThe Organisation will complete a Safety and Quality Account to document achievements, and \\n\\naffirm an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their \\n\\nfunctions. The Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by \\n\\nthe Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory measures, patient safety priorities, \\n\\nservice improvements, integration initiatives, and three additional locally selected high priority \\n\\nmeasures. Locally selected high priority measures must demonstrate a holistic approach to \\n\\nsafety and quality, and at least one of these must focus on improving safety and quality for \\n\\nAboriginal patients.  \\n\\nThe Account must also demonstrate how the Organisation meets Standard 1. Clinical \\n\\nGovernance, of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which describes \\n\\nthe clinical governance, and safety and quality systems that are required to maintain and \\n\\nimprove the reliability, safety and quality of health care, and improve health outcomes for \\n\\npatients. Standard 1 ensures that frontline clinicians, managers and members of governing \\n\\nbodies, such as boards, are accountable to patients and the community for assuring the \\n\\ndelivery of health services that are safe, effective, integrated, high quality and continuously \\n\\nimproving.  \\n\\nConsistent with the National Health Reform Agreement, The Organisation must continue to \\n\\nfocus on reducing the incidence of hospital acquired complications. Through the Purchasing \\n\\nFramework, NSW Health has incentivised Districts and Networks to invest in quality \\n\\nimprovement initiatives that specifically target these complications. It is expected that the \\n\\nSafety and Quality Account articulates these initiatives and provides details on approaches \\n\\nand outcomes.  \\n\\n4.4.5 Performance Framework \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'Service Agreements are a central component of the NSW Health Performance Framework, \\n\\nwhich documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector \\n\\nhealth services to achieve expected service levels, financial performance, governance and \\n\\nother requirements. \\n\\nThe performance of a Health Service is assessed on whether the organisation is meeting the \\n\\nstrategic objectives for NSW Health and government, the Premier’s priorities and performance \\n\\nagainst key performance indicators. The availability and implementation of governance \\n\\nstructures and processes, and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel \\n\\nevent also influences the assessment. \\n\\nThe Framework sets out performance improvement approaches, responses to performance \\n\\nconcerns and management processes that support the achievement of outcomes in \\n\\naccordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. \\n\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at \\n\\nperformance review meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available \\n\\nat: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx \\n\\nhttps://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/Pages/doc.aspx?dn=PD2018_030\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nSchedule A:  Strategies and Priorities \\n\\nThe delivery of NSW Health strategies and priorities is the responsibility of the Ministry, NSW \\n\\nHealth Services and Support Organisations. These are to be reflected in the strategic, \\n\\noperational and business plans of these entities. \\n\\nNSW Government Priorities  \\n\\nThe NSW Government has outlined their priorities for their third term:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Building a strong economy \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Providing high-quality education \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Creating well connected communities \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Providing world class customer service \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Tackling longstanding social challenges \\n\\nNSW Health will contribute to the NSW Government’s priorities in a number of ways:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Our focus and commitment to put the patient at the centre of all that we do will \\n\\ncontinue and be expanded. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We will continue to deliver new and improved health infrastructure and digital \\n\\nsolutions that connect communities and improve quality of life for people in rural, \\n\\nregional and metropolitan areas. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We will help develop solutions to tackle longstanding social challenges including \\n\\nintergenerational disadvantage, suicide and indigenous disadvantage. \\n\\nNSW Health staff will continue to work together to deliver a sustainable health system that \\n\\ndelivers outcomes that matter to patients and community, is personalised, invests in wellness \\n\\nand is digitally enabled. \\n\\nElection Commitments \\n\\nNSW Health is responsible for the delivery of 50 election commitments over the period to \\n\\nMarch 2023. The Ministry of Health will lead the delivery of these commitments with support \\n\\nfrom Health Services and Support Organisations.  \\n\\nMinister’s Priority  \\n\\nNSW Health will strive for engagement, empathy and excellence to promote a positive and \\n\\ncompassionate culture that is shared by managers, front-line clinical and support staff alike. \\n\\nThis culture will ensure the delivery of safe, appropriate, high quality care for our patients and \\n\\ncommunities. To do this, Health Services are to continue to effectively engage with the \\n\\ncommunity, and ensure that managers at all levels are visible and working collaboratively \\n\\nwith staff, patients and carers within their organisation, service or unit. These requirements \\n\\nwill form a critical element of the Safety and Quality Account. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n8 \\n\\nNSW State Health Plan: Towards 2021 \\n\\nThe NSW State Health Plan: Towards 2021 provides a strategic framework which brings \\n\\ntogether NSW Health’s existing plans, programs and policies and sets priorities across the \\n\\nsystem for the delivery of the right care, in the right place, at the right time. See \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards-\\n\\n2021.pdf  \\n\\nNSW Health Strategic Priorities 2019-20 \\n\\nValue based healthcare \\n\\nValue based healthcare (VBHC) is a framework for organising health systems around the \\n\\nconcept of value. In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care \\n\\nthat improves: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The health outcomes that matter to patients \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of receiving care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of providing care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The effectiveness and efficiency of care \\n\\nVBHC builds on our long-held emphasis on safety and quality by increasing the focus on \\n\\ndelivering health outcomes and the experience of receiving care as defined from the patient \\n\\nperspective; systematically measuring outcomes (rather than outputs) and using insights to \\n\\nfurther inform resource allocation decisions; and a more integrated approach across the full \\n\\ncycle of care. \\n\\nImproving patient experience \\n\\nConsistent with NSW Government priorities to improve customers experience for NSW \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'residents, NSW Health is committed to enhancing patients and their carer’s experience of \\n\\ncare.  A structured approach to patient experience that supports a cohesive, strategic and \\n\\nmeasurable approach is being progressed.  An audit in 2018 of initiatives underway across \\n\\nthe NSW Health system identified 260 initiatives across districts, networks and pillar \\n\\norganisations to enhance the patient experience. \\n\\nIn 2019-20, the Ministry of Health will work closely with Health Services and Support \\n\\nOrganisations to progress the strategic approach to improving patient experience across the \\n\\nNSW public health system. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards-2021.pdf\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards-2021.pdf\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\n',\n",

Strategic Deliverables \\n\\nValue based healthcare \\n\\nValue based healthcare (VBHC) is a framework for organising health systems around the concept \\n\\nof value. In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care that improves: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The health outcomes that matter to patients \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of receiving care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of providing care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The effectiveness and efficiency of care \\n\\nVBHC builds on our long-held emphasis on safety and quality by increasing the focus on delivering \\n\\nhealth outcomes and the experience of receiving care as defined from the patient perspective; \\n\\nsystematically measuring outcomes (rather than outputs) and using insights to further inform \\n\\nresource allocation decisions; and a more integrated approach across the full cycle of care. \\n\\nLeading Better Value Care, Commissioning for Better Value and Integrating Care are three \\n\\nprograms helping to accelerate NSW Health’s move to value based healthcare. \\n\\nIntegrating Care \\n\\nIn 2019-20 the Ministry of Health has reinvigorated Integrating Care (IC) with a focus on scaling five \\n\\nlocally developed initiatives which will benefit patients and the system across NSW. The five scaled \\n\\ninitiatives are evidence-based and show benefits in line with the Quadruple Aim. They have been \\n\\nselected because they demonstrate integration throughout the NSW Health system, and with \\n\\nPrimary Health Networks and other clusters.  \\n\\nThe main roles and responsibilities in the IC Program are: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry of Health will continue as system manager and will articulate the priorities for \\n\\nNSW Health. Performance against delivery of the priorities will be monitored in line with the \\n\\nNSW Health Performance Framework. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Districts and Networks will determine local approaches to implement and deliver at least one of \\n\\nthe five Ministry selected IC initiatives in 2019-20. Districts and Networks may also continue to \\n\\nprovide services established through IC in 2017-18 and 2018-19 if deemed viable and locally \\n\\nappropriate to do so.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Pillars, in discussion with the Ministry, may support Districts and Networks in a flexible \\n\\nmanner that can be customised to meet state-wide and local needs, primarily to support \\n\\nimplementation and clinical redesign for the IC initiatives.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Districts and Networks will provide patient-level data to the Ministry of Health to assist \\n\\nevaluation, monitoring and regular reporting of the IC initiatives at a local and state-wide level.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry will hold patient-level IC data and use existing linkage and de-identification \\n\\nprocesses to support comprehensive measurement of the initiatives as required. \\n\\nIn 2019-20, Districts and Networks will: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Work with the Ministry of Health to implement at least one of the 2019-20 IC initiatives: \\n\\no ED to Community (EDC) \\n\\n- IC EDC is an intensive case management approach for people who present to a hospital’s \\n\\nEmergency Department ten times or more in a twelve month period.  \\n\\n',\n",

This \\n\\ntool is already available for Integrated Care for People with Chronic Conditions, and additional \\n\\nmodules will become available for all other Integrated Care initiatives. This will improve data \\n\\ncapture, and minimise the reporting burden for each LHD and SHN.  \\n\\nLeading Better Value Care  \\n\\nThe Leading Better Value Care (LBVC) Program identifies and scales evidence-based initiatives \\n\\nfor specific diseases or conditions and supports their implementation in all local health districts \\n\\nacross the state. The LBVC Program has a strong focus on measurement and evaluation to show \\n\\nthe impact of care across the four domains of value.   \\n\\nThe main roles and responsibilities in the LBVC Program are: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry of Health will continue as system manager and will articulate the priorities for \\n\\nNSW Health. Performance against delivery of the priorities will be monitored in line with the \\n\\nNSW Health Performance Framework. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Districts and Networks will continue to provide services established through LBVC in 2017-18 \\n\\nand 2018-19 and determine local approaches to deliver new LBVC initiatives in 2019-20. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Pillars will continue to support Districts and Networks in a flexible manner that can be \\n\\ncustomised to meet statewide and local needs and will support measurement activities as \\n\\nrequired. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Districts and Networks will participate with Ministry of Health and Pillars in evaluation, \\n\\nmonitoring and regular reporting on the progress of the LBVC initiatives as specified in the \\n\\nMonitoring and Evaluation Plans. \\n\\nIn 2019-20, districts and networks will: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Continue to provide and expand the reach of clinical services in the most appropriate care \\n\\nsetting for patients in LBVC Tranche 1 initiatives of Osteoporotic Refracture Prevention (ORP), \\n\\nOsteoarthritis Chronic Care Program (OACCP), Renal Supportive Care (RSC) and High Risk \\n\\nFoot Services (HRFS) through non-admitted services, including designated HERO clinics. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Continue to implement, expand and embed LBVC approaches, including but not limited to a \\n\\nfocus on activities outlined in Clinical Improvement Activity Briefs for Chronic Heart Failure \\n\\n(CHF), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Inpatient Management of \\n\\nDiabetes. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Continue to sustain improvement work and spread when interventions are reliably practiced to \\n\\n',\n",

CORE Values \\n\\nAchieving the goals, directions and strategies for NSW Health requires clear and co-ordinated \\n\\nprioritisation of work programs, and supportive leadership that exemplifies the CORE Values \\n\\nof NSW Health:   \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Collaboration – we are committed to working collaboratively with each other to achieve the \\n\\nbest possible outcomes for our patients who are at the centre of everything we do.  In \\n\\nworking collaboratively we acknowledge that every person working in the health system \\n\\nplays a valuable role that contributes to achieving the best possible outcomes. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Openness – a commitment to openness in our communications builds confidence and \\n\\ngreater cooperation.  We are committed to encouraging our patients, and all people who \\n\\nwork in the health system, to provide feedback that will help us provide better services. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Respect – we have respect for the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements of all \\n\\npeople who work in the health system.  We are also committed to providing health services \\n\\nthat acknowledge and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients and their \\n\\ncarers. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Empowerment – in providing quality health care services we aim to ensure our patients \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'are able to make well informed and confident decisions about their care and treatment.  \\n\\nWe further aim to create a sense of empowerment in the workplace for people to use their \\n\\nknowledge, skills and experience to provide the best possible care to patients, their \\n\\nfamilies and carers.  \\n\\n3. Culture, Community and Workforce Engagement  \\n\\nThe Organisation must ensure appropriate consultation and engagement with patients, carers \\n\\nand communities in the design and delivery of health services. Impact Statements, including \\n\\nAboriginal Health Impact Statements, are to be considered and, where relevant, incorporated \\n\\ninto health policies. Consistent with the principles of accountability and stakeholder \\n\\nconsultation, the engagement of clinical staff in key decisions, such as resource allocation and \\n\\nservice planning, is crucial to the achievement of local priorities. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n4 \\n\\n3.1 Engagement Surveys \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The People Matter Employee Survey measures the experiences of individuals across the \\n\\nNSW Health system in working with their team, managers and the organisation. The \\n\\nresults of the survey will be used to identify areas of both best practice and improvement \\n\\nopportunities, to determine how change can be affected at an individual, organisational \\n\\nand system level to improve workplace culture and practices.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Junior Medical Officer Your Training and Wellbeing Matters Survey will monitor the \\n\\nquality of supervision, education and training provided to junior medical officers and their \\n\\nwelfare and wellbeing. The survey will also identify areas of best practice and further \\n\\nopportunities for improvement at an organisational and system level. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Australian Medical Association, in conjunction with the Australian Salaried Medical \\n\\nOfficers Association, will undertake regular surveys of senior medical staff to assess \\n\\nclinical participation and involvement in local decision making to deliver patient centred \\n\\ncare. \\n\\n4. Legislation, Governance and Performance Framework \\n\\n4.1 Legislation  \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health \\n\\nsystem, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss \\n\\n8, 9, 10). \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of \\n\\ngovernance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health \\n\\norganisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health \\n\\nsystem, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system \\n\\n(s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health \\n\\nDistricts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The \\n\\nperformance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be \\n\\nused for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n4.2 Variation of the Agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the \\n\\nOrganisation and the Ministry. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general \\n\\npowers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local \\n\\nHealth Districts (s. 32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement \\n\\nwill be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry in the course \\n\\nof the year. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n5 \\n\\n4.3 National Agreement - Hospital funding and health reform \\n\\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has reaffirmed that providing universal health \\n\\ncare for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public \\n\\nhospitals funding from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020. That Agreement maintains activity based \\n\\nfunding and the national efficient price. There is a focus on improved patient safety, quality of \\n\\nservices and reduced unnecessary hospitalisations. The Commonwealth will continue its focus \\n\\non reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce \\n\\navoidable hospital admissions.

The NSW Health Procurement Policy is to be applied in conjunction with \\n\\nprocedures detailed in the NSW Health Goods and Services Procurement Policy Directive \\n\\n(PD2018_030). These documents detail the requirements of all staff undertaking procurement \\n\\nor disposal of goods and services on behalf of NSW Health.  \\n\\nhttps://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/Pages/doc.aspx?dn=PD2018_030 \\n\\n4.4.4 Safety and Quality Accounts \\n\\nThe Organisation will complete a Safety and Quality Account to document achievements, and \\n\\naffirm an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their \\n\\nfunctions. The Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by \\n\\nthe Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory measures, patient safety priorities, \\n\\nservice improvements, integration initiatives, and three additional locally selected high priority \\n\\nmeasures. Locally selected high priority measures must demonstrate a holistic approach to \\n\\nsafety and quality, and at least one of these must focus on improving safety and quality for \\n\\nAboriginal patients.  \\n\\nThe Account must also demonstrate how the Organisation meets Standard 1. Clinical \\n\\nGovernance, of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which describes \\n\\nthe clinical governance, and safety and quality systems that are required to maintain and \\n\\nimprove the reliability, safety and quality of health care, and improve health outcomes for \\n\\npatients. Standard 1 ensures that frontline clinicians, managers and members of governing \\n\\nbodies, such as boards, are accountable to patients and the community for assuring the \\n\\ndelivery of health services that are safe, effective, integrated, high quality and continuously \\n\\nimproving.  \\n\\nConsistent with the National Health Reform Agreement, The Organisation must continue to \\n\\nfocus on reducing the incidence of hospital acquired complications. Through the Purchasing \\n\\nFramework, NSW Health has incentivised Districts and Networks to invest in quality \\n\\nimprovement initiatives that specifically target these complications. It is expected that the \\n\\nSafety and Quality Account articulates these initiatives and provides details on approaches \\n\\nand outcomes.  \\n\\n4.4.5 Performance Framework \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'Service Agreements are a central component of the NSW Health Performance Framework, \\n\\nwhich documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector \\n\\nhealth services to achieve expected service levels, financial performance, governance and \\n\\nother requirements. \\n\\nThe performance of a Health Service is assessed on whether the organisation is meeting the \\n\\nstrategic objectives for NSW Health and government, the Premier’s priorities and performance \\n\\nagainst key performance indicators. The availability and implementation of governance \\n\\nstructures and processes, and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel \\n\\nevent also influences the assessment. \\n\\nThe Framework sets out performance improvement approaches, responses to performance \\n\\nconcerns and management processes that support the achievement of outcomes in \\n\\naccordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. \\n\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at \\n\\nperformance review meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available \\n\\nat: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx \\n\\nhttps://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/Pages/doc.aspx?dn=PD2018_030\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n7 \\n\\nSchedule A:  Strategies and Priorities \\n\\nThe delivery of NSW Health strategies and priorities is the responsibility of the Ministry, NSW \\n\\nHealth Services and Support Organisations. These are to be reflected in the strategic, \\n\\noperational and business plans of these entities. \\n\\nNSW Government Priorities  \\n\\nThe NSW Government has outlined their priorities for their third term:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Building a strong economy \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Providing high-quality education \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Creating well connected communities \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Providing world class customer service \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Tackling longstanding social challenges \\n\\nNSW Health will contribute to the NSW Government’s priorities in a number of ways:  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Our focus and commitment to put the patient at the centre of all that we do will \\n\\ncontinue and be expanded. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We will continue to deliver new and improved health infrastructure and digital \\n\\nsolutions that connect communities and improve quality of life for people in rural, \\n\\nregional and metropolitan areas. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We will help develop solutions to tackle longstanding social challenges including \\n\\nintergenerational disadvantage, suicide and indigenous disadvantage. \\n\\nNSW Health staff will continue to work together to deliver a sustainable health system that \\n\\ndelivers outcomes that matter to patients and community, is personalised, invests in wellness \\n\\nand is digitally enabled. \\n\\nElection Commitments \\n\\nNSW Health is responsible for the delivery of 50 election commitments over the period to \\n\\nMarch 2023. The Ministry of Health will lead the delivery of these commitments with support \\n\\nfrom Health Services and Support Organisations.  \\n\\nMinister’s Priority  \\n\\nNSW Health will strive for engagement, empathy and excellence to promote a positive and \\n\\ncompassionate culture that is shared by managers, front-line clinical and support staff alike. \\n\\nThis culture will ensure the delivery of safe, appropriate, high quality care for our patients and \\n\\ncommunities. To do this, Health Services are to continue to effectively engage with the \\n\\ncommunity, and ensure that managers at all levels are visible and working collaboratively \\n\\nwith staff, patients and carers within their organisation, service or unit. These requirements \\n\\nwill form a critical element of the Safety and Quality Account. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n8 \\n\\nNSW State Health Plan: Towards 2021 \\n\\nThe NSW State Health Plan: Towards 2021 provides a strategic framework which brings \\n\\ntogether NSW Health’s existing plans, programs and policies and sets priorities across the \\n\\nsystem for the delivery of the right care, in the right place, at the right time. See \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards-\\n\\n2021.pdf  \\n\\nNSW Health Strategic Priorities 2019-20 \\n\\nValue based healthcare \\n\\nValue based healthcare (VBHC) is a framework for organising health systems around the \\n\\nconcept of value. In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care \\n\\nthat improves: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The health outcomes that matter to patients \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of receiving care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of providing care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The effectiveness and efficiency of care \\n\\nVBHC builds on our long-held emphasis on safety and quality by increasing the focus on \\n\\ndelivering health outcomes and the experience of receiving care as defined from the patient \\n\\nperspective; systematically measuring outcomes (rather than outputs) and using insights to \\n\\nfurther inform resource allocation decisions; and a more integrated approach across the full \\n\\ncycle of care. \\n\\nImproving patient experience \\n\\nConsistent with NSW Government priorities to improve customers experience for NSW \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'residents, NSW Health is committed to enhancing patients and their carer’s experience of \\n\\ncare.  A structured approach to patient experience that supports a cohesive, strategic and \\n\\nmeasurable approach is being progressed.  An audit in 2018 of initiatives underway across \\n\\nthe NSW Health system identified 260 initiatives across districts, networks and pillar \\n\\norganisations to enhance the patient experience. \\n\\nIn 2019-20, the Ministry of Health will work closely with Health Services and Support \\n\\nOrganisations to progress the strategic approach to improving patient experience across the \\n\\nNSW public health system. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards-2021.pdf\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards-2021.pdf\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n9 \\n\\n',\n",

Strategic Deliverables \\n\\nValue based healthcare \\n\\nValue based healthcare (VBHC) is a framework for organising health systems around the concept \\n\\nof value. In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care that improves: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The health outcomes that matter to patients \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of receiving care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The experience of providing care \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The effectiveness and efficiency of care \\n\\nVBHC builds on our long-held emphasis on safety and quality by increasing the focus on delivering \\n\\nhealth outcomes and the experience of receiving care as defined from the patient perspective; \\n\\nsystematically measuring outcomes (rather than outputs) and using insights to further inform \\n\\nresource allocation decisions; and a more integrated approach across the full cycle of care. \\n\\nLeading Better Value Care, Commissioning for Better Value and Integrating Care are three \\n\\nprograms helping to accelerate NSW Health’s move to value based healthcare. \\n\\nIntegrating Care \\n\\nIn 2019-20 the Ministry of Health has reinvigorated Integrating Care (IC) with a focus on scaling five \\n\\nlocally developed initiatives which will benefit patients and the system across NSW. The five scaled \\n\\ninitiatives are evidence-based and show benefits in line with the Quadruple Aim. They have been \\n\\nselected because they demonstrate integration throughout the NSW Health system, and with \\n\\nPrimary Health Networks and other clusters.  \\n\\nThe main roles and responsibilities in the IC Program are: \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Ministry of Health will continue as system manager and will articulate the priorities for \\n\\nNSW Health.

Legislation, governance and performance framework \\n\\n2.1 Legislation \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, \\n\\nincluding setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss 8, 9, 10). \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, \\n\\noversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as \\n\\nwell as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient \\n\\nand economic operation of the public health system (s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts \\n\\nin relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance \\n\\nagreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for \\n\\nthose purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n2.2 Variation of the agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and \\n\\nthe Ministry of Health. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general powers \\n\\nunder the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health Districts (s. \\n\\n32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be \\n\\nprovided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry of Health in the course of \\n\\nthe year. \\n\\n2.3 National Agreement \\n\\nThe National Cabinet has reaffirmed that providing universal healthcare for all Australians is a shared \\n\\npriority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2020 to 30 June \\n\\n2025. That Agreement maintains activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus \\n\\non improved patient safety, quality of services and reduced unnecessary hospitalisations. The \\n\\nCommonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient \\n\\noutcomes and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.

Locally selected \\n\\nhigh priority measures must demonstrate a holistic approach to safety and quality, and at least one of \\n\\nthese must focus on improving safety and quality for Aboriginal patients. \\n\\n2.4.5 Performance Framework \\n\\nService Agreements are a central component of the NSW Health Performance Framework, which \\n\\ndocuments how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector health services to \\n\\nachieve expected service levels, financial performance, governance and other requirements. \\n\\nThe performance of a health service is assessed on whether the Organisation is meeting the strategic \\n\\nobjectives for NSW Health and government, the Premier’s Priorities and performance against key \\n\\nperformance indicators. The availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, \\n\\nand whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event also influences the \\n\\nassessment. \\n\\nThe Framework sets out responses to performance concerns and management processes that support \\n\\nthe achievement of outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. \\n\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance \\n\\nreview meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at: \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n2020–21 Service Agreement: Strategies and local priorities     7 \\n\\n3.

Legislation, governance and performance framework \\n\\n2.1 Legislation \\n\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, \\n\\nincluding setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss 8, 9, 10). \\n\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and \\n\\nmaintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, \\n\\noversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as \\n\\nwell as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient \\n\\nand economic operation of the public health system (s.122). \\n\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts \\n\\nin relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance \\n\\nagreement may include provisions of a service agreement. \\n\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any \\n\\nsubsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for \\n\\nthose purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary. \\n\\n2.2 Variation of the agreement \\n\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and \\n\\nthe Ministry of Health. \\n\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general powers \\n\\nunder the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health Districts (s. \\n\\n32). \\n\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be \\n\\nprovided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry of Health in the course of \\n\\nthe year. \\n\\n2.3 National Agreement \\n\\nThe National Cabinet has reaffirmed that providing universal healthcare for all Australians is a shared \\n\\npriority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2020 to 30 June \\n\\n2025. That Agreement maintains activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus \\n\\non improved patient safety, quality of services and reduced unnecessary hospitalisations. The \\n\\nCommonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient \\n\\noutcomes and reduce avoidable hospital admissions.

The \\n\\naccount documents achievements and affirms an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating \\n\\nsafety and quality into their functions.  \\n\\nThe Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by the Organisation, \\n\\nincluding key state-wide mandatory measures, patient safety priorities, service improvements, \\n\\nintegration initiatives, and three additional locally selected high priority measures. Locally selected \\n\\nhigh priority measures must demonstrate a holistic approach to safety and quality, and at least one of \\n\\nthese must focus on improving safety and quality for Aboriginal patients. \\n\\n2.4.5 Performance Framework \\n\\nService Agreements are a central component of the NSW Health Performance Framework, which \\n\\ndocuments how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector health services to \\n\\nachieve expected service levels, financial performance, governance and other requirements. \\n\\nThe performance of a health service is assessed on whether the Organisation is meeting the strategic \\n\\nobjectives for NSW Health and government, the Premier’s Priorities and performance against key \\n\\nperformance indicators. The availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, \\n\\nand whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event also influences the \\n\\nassessment. \\n\\nThe Framework sets out responses to performance concerns and management processes that support \\n\\nthe achievement of outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. \\n\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance \\n\\nreview meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at: \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx \\n\\n \\n\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n2020–21 Service Agreement: Strategies and local priorities     7 \\n\\n3.

Legislation, governance and performance framework\\n2.1 Legislation\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss 8, 9, 10).\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and maintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system (s.122).\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement.\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any subsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary.\\n2.2 Variation of the agreement\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and the Ministry of Health.\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general powers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health Districts (s. 32).\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry of Health in the course of the year.\\n2.3 National Agreement\\nThe National Cabinet has reaffirmed that providing universal healthcare for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2020 to 30 June 2025. That Agreement maintains activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus on improved patient safety, quality of services and reduced unnecessary hospitalisations. The Commonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable hospital admissions. See http://www.coag.gov.au/agreements\\n2.4 Governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, obligations and accountabilities are understood and complied with and that services are provided in a manner consistent with all NSW Health policies, procedures, plans, circulars, inter-agency agreements, Ministerial directives and other instruments and statutory obligations.\\n2.4.1 Clinical governance\\nNSW public health services are accredited against the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards.\\n',\n",
       "                'https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/nsqhs-standards- second-edition/\\nThe Australian Safety and Quality Framework for Health Care provides a set of guiding principles that can assist health services with their clinical governance obligations.\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/publications-and-resources/resource-library/australian-safety- and-quality-framework-health-care\\nThe NSW Patient Safety and Clinical Quality Program provides an important framework for improvements to clinical quality.\\nhttp://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/ActivePDSDocuments/PD2005_608.pdf\\n2.4.2 Corporate governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure services are delivered in a manner consistent with the NSW Health Corporate Governance and Accountability Compendium (the Compendium) seven corporate governance standards. The Compendium is at:\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/manuals/pages/corporate-governance-compendium.aspx Where applicable, the Organisation is to:\\n• Provide required reports in accordance with timeframes advised by the Ministry;\\n• Review and update the Manual of Delegations (PD2012_059) to ensure currency;\\n• Ensure recommendations of the NSW Auditor-General, the Public Accounts Committee and the NSW Ombudsman, where accepted by NSW Health, are actioned in a timely and effective manner, and that repeat audit issues are avoided.\\n2.4.3 Procurement governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure procurement of goods and services complies with the NSW Health Goods and Services Procurement Policy Directive (PD2019_028). This policy directive details the requirements for all staff undertaking procurement or disposal of goods and services on behalf of NSW Health. https://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/Pages/doc.aspx?dn=PD2019_028\\n\\n2.4.4 Safety and Quality Accounts\\nThe Organisation will complete a Safety and Quality Account inclusive of an annual attestation statement as outlined by the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards (Version 2.0). The account documents achievements and affirms an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their functions.\\nThe Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by the Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory measures, patient safety priorities, service improvements, integration initiatives, and three additional locally selected high priority measures. Locally selected high priority measures must demonstrate a holistic approach to safety and quality, and at least one of these must focus on improving safety and quality for Aboriginal patients.\\n2.4.5 Performance Framework\\nService Agreements are a central component of the NSW Health Performance Framework, which documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector health services to achieve expected service levels, financial performance, governance and other requirements.\\nThe performance of a health service is assessed on whether the Organisation is meeting the strategic objectives for NSW Health and government, the Premier’s Priorities and performance against key performance indicators. The availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event also influences the assessment.\\nThe Framework sets out responses to performance concerns and management processes that support the achievement of outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities. Performance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance review meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\n3. Strategies and local priorities\\nThe delivery of NSW Health strategies and priorities is the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, health services and support organisations. These are to be reflected in the strategic, operational and business plans of these entities.\\n3.1 NSW Premier’s Priorities\\nIn June 2019, the NSW Premier set new social priorities to tackle tough community challenges, lift the quality of life for everyone in NSW and put people at the heart of everything the Government does.\\nNSW Health is leading the three priorities for improving the health system:\\nNSW Health staff will continue to work together to deliver a sustainable health system that delivers outcomes that matter to patients and the community, is personalised, invests in wellness and is digitally enabled.\\nImproving outpatient and community care\\nImproving service levels in hospitals\\nReduce preventable hospital visits by 5 per cent through to 2023 by caring for people in the community.\\n100 per cent of all triage category 1, 95 per cent of triage category 2 and 85 per cent of triage category 3 patients commencing treatment on time by 2023.\\nTowards zero suicides Reduce the rate of suicide deaths in NSW by 20 per cent by 2023.\\n\\n',\n",

The overarching objective of Outcome Budgeting is to shift the focus of the NSW Government to deliver better outcomes for the people of NSW with increased transparency, accountability and value (TPP 18-091 ).\\nThe NSW Health Outcome and Business Plan is an agreement between the Minister for Health and Medical Research, the Secretary, NSW Health and the NSW Government setting out the outcomes and objectives that will be focused on over the next four years.\\nNSW Health has identified five state outcomes that it will achieve for the people of NSW. The state outcomes cover the broad range of functions and services provided across care settings.\\n1. Keeping people healthy through prevention and health promotion\\n2.

In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care that improves:\\n• The health outcomes that matter to patients\\n• The experience of receiving care\\n• The experience of providing care\\n• The effectiveness and efficiency of care\\nNSW Health is implementing value based healthcare by scaling and embedding statewide programs (including Integrated Care, Leading Better Value Care, Collaborative Commissioning, and Commissioning for Better Value), while supporting change through a range of system-wide enablers. Value based healthcare is aligned with our Strategic Priorities and the focus of the NSW Government to deliver better outcomes for the people of NSW.\\nLeading Better Value Care\\nThe focus for the Leading Better Value Care program is to continue to sustainably scale and embed existing Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 initiatives. Districts should continue progress on the 2019-20 deliverables, with a specific focus on using virtual care where appropriate to improve the reach, outcomes and experiences from the LBVC initiatives.\\nThe Ministry of Health and Pillar organisations will continue to assist districts by developing statewide enablers and delivering tailored local support activities.\\nIntegrating care\\nIt is expected that the Organisation will:\\n• Record new patient enrolments for all scaled initiatives in the Patient Flow Portal by 31 December 2020 (except Integrated Care- Residential Aged Care facility focussed initiative).\\n• Transition from the Integrated Care for People with Chronic Conditions model to the Planned Care for Better Health (PCBH) model to deliver a service inclusive of all chronic diseases by delivering the following milestones:\\n1. Submit a local implementation plan outlining how the Organisation will meet the four core elements outlined in the PCBH Transformation plan (patient identification, assessment and selection, intervention delivery and monitoring and review) by 15 December 2020\\n2. Commence use of the Risk of Hospitalisation algorithm to identify suitable patients replacing the Chronic Conditions Patient Identification Algorithm by 31 March 2020\\n7.2.3 Towards Zero Suicides\\nImplementation of the three initiatives:\\n1. Zero Suicides in Care,\\n2. Alternatives to Emergency Departments,\\n3. Assertive Suicide Prevention Outreach Teams\\nFor each of the three initiatives:\\n• The Organisation will recruit the minimum required FTE as per the supplementation letter, including peer workers with a lived experience of suicide.\\n• The Organisation will submit an implementation plan to the Ministry that is informed by a local co- design process.\\n• The Organisation will commence delivering the initiative.\\n2020–21 Service Agreement: Performance against strategies and objectives\\n\\n'],\n",

       "                \"One important way the CORE values can be realised is through active engagement of LHDs, other Health Services and Support Organisations with the NSW Health Performance Framework. The annually negotiated Service Agreements with Local Health Districts and other Health Services, and the Compacts between the Ministry and Support Organisations, ensure that the priorities of NSW Health are delivered. Building upon the goals set by NSW 2021: A Plan to Make NSW Number One, the priorities for NSW Health are: Building healthy communities . . Integrated care High quality, sustainable services The Service Agreement operates within the NSW Health Performance Framework and in the context of the NSW Health Funding Reform, Purchasing Framework and NSW Activity Based Funding and Small Hospitals Operational Specifications. Local Health Districts, other Health Services and Support Organisations are core to the NSW Health System and are fundamental to the delivery of key goals and outcomes. Collaboration with other relevant entities, including Medicare Locals, Non-Government Organisations, the Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Sector, Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council and other Government agencies is essential to achieving these goals. Appropriate consultation and engagement with clinicians, patients and communities in relation to the design and delivery of health services is also an LHD responsibility, including consideration of how best to support the needs of carers in the design and delivery of their services. NSW Health Services and Support Organisations are also part of the NSW Public Sector and its governance and accountability framework. Boards must have effective governance and risk management processes in place to ensure compliance with this wider public sector framework (refer Schedule F for further detail on govemance requirements). Developments under the National Health Reform Agreement further inform this Agreement, which may require corresponding updates or amendments over time.

Page | 12 \\n\\n\\n\\nSpecific Focus Areas for 2014/15 \\n\\nLocal Accountability and Clinician Engagement \\n\\nOne of the primary objectives of the recent reform of the NSW health system is the devolution of \\ndecision-making authority and performance accountability to LHDs. Strong clinician engagement \\nis essential to ensuring the involvement of clinicians in key decisions, such as resource allocation \\nand service planning, thereby providing an invaluable contribution to improving health system \\noutcomes and to ensuring sound clinician governance. \\n\\nLHDs are expected to strengthen clinician leadership throughout all levels of the organisation by \\nfacilitating the active participation of clinicians in decision-making processes regarding service \\ndelivery and planning, quality and safety systems, appropriate models of care and resource \\nallocation. On an annual basis, LHDs will be required to report on the mechanisms they have \\nimplemented to ensure effective clinician engagement and leadership to demonstrate: \\n\\n• Clinician input at Board level. \\n\\n• Clinician input at key Executive-level Committees (both LHD and facility-level). \\n\\n• Clinician influence in service planning and resource allocation. \\n\\n• Engagement with the wider health sector (including primary and community care). \\n\\n• Effective linkages between Clinical Councils and the LHD Board. \\n\\n• Effective mechanisms to ensure Medical Staff Council input to hospital-level Committees. \\n\\nTo support an assessment of the effectiveness of clinician engagement at the local level, an \\nannual survey will be undertaken to gauge the perceptions of senior medical staff employed \\nwithin LHDs, as to the depth and quality of engagement with them, as a group, by their \\nrespective LHD Chief Executive. It is intended that the results of these surveys will be provided to \\nthe Ministry of Health and shared with LHD Board Chairs to assist in the performance review of \\nmanagement with respect to clinician engagement. \\n\\nIntegrated Care Strategy \\n\\nAgeing, advances in science and technology, and increasing community expectations contribute \\nto growing health care expenditure. In response, a key challenge for NSW is to transform the \\nhealth system from one that is hospital-centric and designed to provide episodic treatment, to a \\nmore integrated health system, with connected service provision across different care providers \\n(both within NSW Health and more widely), a greater emphasis on community-based services \\nthat better support people with long term conditions. \\n\\nIn the NSW health system context, integrated care involves the provision of seamless, effective \\nand efficient care that reflects the whole of a person's health needs; from prevention through to \\nend of life, across both physical and mental health, and in partnership with the individual, their \\ncarers and family. It is a system of care and support that is based around the needs of the \\nindividual, and that ensures provision of the right care, in the right place, at the right time. \\n\\nIntegrated care is seen as a pivotal strategy for meeting these challenges in NSW. Reflecting \\nthis, the NSW Government has committed $120 million over four years from 2013/14 for \\ninvestment in new, innovative models of integrated care. The aim is to move towards a \\nsustainable health system that better meets the needs of the people of NSW, through: \\n\\n• Connecting different care providers to deliver person-centred care. \\n\\n• Enabling care to be provided in the most appropriate setting. \\n\\n\",\n",

Resonla provanton and early intervention \\n\\n Specific Focus Areas for 2014/15 Local Accountability and Clinician Engagement One of the primary objectives of the recent reform of the NSW health system is the devolution of decision-making authority and performance accountability to LHDs. Strong clinician engagement is essential to ensuring the involvement of clinicians in key decisions, such as resource allocation and service planning, thereby providing an invaluable contribution to improving health system outcomes and to ensuring sound clinician governance. LHDs are expected to strengthen clinician leadership throughout all levels of the organisation by facilitating the active participation of clinicians in decision-making processes regarding service delivery and planning, quality and safety systems, appropriate models of care and resource allocation. On an annual basis, LHDs will be required to report on the mechanisms they have implemented to ensure effective clinician engagement and leadership to demonstrate: Clinician input at Board level. Clinician input at key Executive-level Committees (both LHD and facility-level). . Clinician influence in service planning and resource allocation. Engagement with the wider health sector (including primary and community care). Effective linkages between Clinical Councils and the LHD Board. Effective mechanisms to ensure Medical Staff Council input to hospital-level Committees. To support an assessment of the effectiveness of clinician engagement at the local level, an annual survey will be undertaken to gauge the perceptions of senior medical staff employed within LHDs, as to the depth and quality of engagement with them, as a group, by their respective LHD Chief Executive. It is inten ded that the results of these surveys will be provided to the Ministry of Health and shared with LHD Board Chairs to assist in the performance review of management with respect to clinician engagement. Integrated Care Strategy Ageing, advances in science and technology, and increasing community expectations contribute to growing health care expenditure. ',\n",
       "                \"In response, a key challenge for NSW is to transform the health system from one that is hospital-centric and designed to provide episodic treatment, to a more integrated health system, with connected service provision across different care providers (both within NSW Health and more widely), a greater emphasis on community-based services that better support people with long term conditions. In the NSW health system context, integrated care involves the provision of seamless, effective and efficient care that reflects the whole of a person's health needs; from prevention through to end of life, across both physical and mental health, and in partnership with the individual, their carers and family. It is a system of care and support that is based around the needs of the individual, and that ensures provision of the right care, in the right place, at the right time. Integrated care is seen as a pivotal strategy for meeting these challenges in NSW. Reflecting this, the NSW Government has committed $120 million over four years from 2013/14 for investment in new, innovative models of integrated care. The aim is to move towards a sustainable health system that better meets the needs of the people of NSW, through: . Connecting different care providers to deliver person-centred care. Enabling care to be provided in the most appropriate setting. . Reinforcing prevention and early intervention. · Embedding individual responsibility for health.

This is because the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority introduced a number of significant changes in the patient classifications used for Activity Based Funding (ABF). Direct comparison between NWAU14 price and activity to last year\\'s NWAU13 is therefore not applicable. Further information on the technical aspects of the changes in NWAU14 will be issued in the NSW Activity Based Management (ABM) and Activity Based Funding (ABF) Compendium 2014/15. The following notes relate to the specific elements of the Schedule C tables: SCHEDULE C - PART 1 ROW SECTIONS A AND B - ABF EXPENDITURE ALLOCATION Activity targets for Acute, Emergency Department and Sub acute are used to set the ABF budget for these service streams. The value of the NWAU is multiplied against the lower of either the Local Health Districts/Specialist Health Network\\'s (LHD/SHN) projected average cost (calculated for all streams, excluding Non Admitted Patient services) or the State Price to calculate the expense budget for each category. For 2014/15, growth funding has been provided at full State Price for all LHD/SHNs. Activity targets for Non Admitted Services - for these services, the budget allocation has been determined by multiplying the average cost from the Non-Admitted patient level costing results, as reported in the District Network Return (DNR) (2012/13) (where available), and the Non-Admitted activity targets for 2014/15. Whilst significant improvements have been observed in the collection of patient level data for Non Admitted services, this process has remained consistent with the previous year as a result of the significant amount of volatility in the data still remaining. ROW SECTION C - MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES This section reflects the budget allocation for Mental Health Services whether funded on an ABF basis or through block funding. The principles for funding the ABF component are consistent with those described above for all other ABF services. A small number of standalone psychiatric hospitals have been block funded as they did not meet the criteria for Independent Hospital Pricing Authority\\'s (IHPA) small hospitals methodology. ',\n",
       "                'In 2014/15, Mental Health Non Admitted services continue to be block funded while a new Mental Health Classification for ABF is being developed by IHPA. A separate transition grant has been identified for Mental Health to maintain the visibility of Government funding commitments for these services. Any Mental Health Transition grant in this section has been calculated in accordance with the principles described below (refer to Row Section F). It is important to note that some Mental Health resources are also included in row section D which contains Mental Health services resources allocated to Block Funded Hospitals (Small Hospitals) and Teaching, Training and Research and row section E which contains Mental Health services resources deemed to be out of scope for the National Health Reform Agreement (NHRA), such as some child and adolescent services. Page | 34 \\n\\n\\n\\nROW SECTION 0— BLOCK FUNDING ALLOCATION \\n\\nBlock Funded Hospitals (Small Hospitals). For 2014/15, and consistent with the previous \\nyear, NSW has adopted the mechanics of the funding model developed by IHPA for Block \\nFunded Hospitals, informed by more recent data than used in the IHPA model. In addition for \\n2014/15, an average of 1% additional growth has been included above the general indexation \\nprovided. \\n\\nBlock Funded Services \"In Scope\" includes Teaching, Training and Research and Other \\nNon-Admitted hospital services as defined by IHPA. A number of services previously funded in \\nthe Other Non-Admitted category have now been reclassified into ABF in accordance with \\nchanges reflected in the 2014/15 IHPA Pricing Framework \\n\\nROW SECTION E — STATE ONLY BLOCK FUNDED SERVICES \\n\\nThese include State based services that are not subject to Commonwealth funding contribution \\nunder the NHRA. They include a number of population, aboriginal health and community based \\nservices. A number of services previously funded in the State Only Block - Non-Admitted \\ncategory have now been reclassified into ABF. \\n\\nROW SECTION F — TRANSITION GRANT \\n\\nTransition grants have again been applied for 2014/15 using the same methodology as previous \\nyears. Transition grants are in place when an LHD/SHN reports a Projected Average Cost \\n(across all streams excluding Non-Admitted Services) exceeding the State Price. \\n\\nACUTE AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT \\n\\nFor 2014/15, LHD/SHN\\'s with Acute and or ED transition grants will be required to utilise a \\nproportion of their transition grant to fund growth in activity. The method of calculating the \\namount of transition grant to be applied to growth is as follows: \\n\\n1. Where the transition grant exceeds 1% of the overall ABF budget of a LHD/SHN, a \\nmaximum of 50% of the growth funding for Acute and Emergency Department has been \\nfunded through a reduction in the transition grant. \\n\\n2. Where the transition grant did not exceed 1% of the overall ABF budget of a LHD/SHN, \\n100% of the transition grant has been made available to fund the growth for Acute and ED \\nsubject to a maximum of 50% of the growth been funded through a reduction in the \\ntransition grant. \\n\\nThe application of these principles has been reflected in the table below: \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n2-(1f471-8-- \\t1477)5 Rnil-1  2014/15 \\nApplication of Transition Grant to Growth \\t NWAU14 \\tApplied to \\tas per Sch \\n\\nGrowth $ (000\\'s) \\n\\n\\t\\n\\n$ (000\\'s) \\t$ (000\\'s) \\tI \\nAcute Admitted \\t$30,213 -$7,159 $23,054 \\n\\nEmergency Department \\t$21,620 -$5,123 $16,497 \\n\\nNon Admitted (including Sub-Acute Non Admitted) \\n\\nSub-Acute Admitted \\t$9,243 $9,243 \\n\\nMental Health - Admitted (Acute and Sub-Acute) \\t$1,246 $1,246-1  \\n\\nBlock Funded Hospitals (Small Hospitals) \\n\\nTotal: 1 \\t$62,322 -$12,282 $50,040 \\n\\nPagel 35 \\n\\n www; NOW her adopted :he mauhenics of the funding mede, covelones by HPA for 3 ook Noordmitted hos sila services ds osEres a, IHPA.

For 2014/15, and consistent with the previous year, NSW has adopted the mechanics of the funding model developed by IHPA for Block Funded Hospitals, informed by more recent data than used in the IHPA model. In addition for 2014/15, an average of 1% additional growth has been included above the general indexation provided. Block Funded Services \"In Scope\" includes Teaching, Training and Research and Other Non-Admitted hospital services as defined by IHPA. A number of services previously funded in the Other Non-Admitted category have now been reclassified into ABF in accordance with changes reflected in the 2014/15 IHPA Pricing Framework ROW SECTION E - STATE ONLY BLOCK FUNDED SERVICES These include State based services that are not subject to Commonwealth funding contribution under the NHRA. They include a number of population, aboriginal health and community based services. A number of services previously funded in the State Only Block - Non-Admitted category have now been reclassified into ABF. ROW SECTION F - TRANSITION GRANT Transition grants have again been applied for 2014/15 using the same methodology as previous years. Transition grants are in place when an LHD/SHN reports a Projected Average Cost (across all streams excluding Non-Admitted Services) exceeding the State Price. ACUTE AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT For 2014/15, LHD/SHN\\'s with Acute and or ED transition grants will be required to utilise a proportion of their transition grant to fund growth in activity. The method of calculating the amount of transition grant to be applied to growth is as follows: 1. Where the transition grant exceeds 1% of the overall ABF budget of a LHD/SHN, a maximum of 50% of the growth funding for Acute and Emergency Department has been funded through a reduction in the transition grant. 2. Where the transition grant did not exceed 1% of the overall ABF budget of a LHD/SHN, 100% of the transition grant has been made available to fund the growth for Acute and ED subject to a maximum of 50% of the growth been funded through a reduction in the transition grant. The application of these principles has been reflected in the table below: 2014/15 2014/15 14/15 Final Application of Transition Grant to Growth NW AU14 Applied to as per Sch $ (000\\'s) Growth C $ (000\\'s) $ (000\\'s) Acute Admitted $30,213| $7,159 $23,054 Emergency Department: $21,620 $5,123 $16,497 Non Admitted (including Sub-Acute Non Admitted) Sub-Acute Admitted $9,243 $9,243 Mental Health - Admitted (Acute and Sub-Acute) $1,246 $1,246 Block Funded Hospitals (Small Hospitals) Total: $62,322 -$12,282 $50,040 Page | 35 \\n\\n\\n\\nNon-Admitted, Sub-Acute and Mental Health \\n\\nCalculations for Non Admitted Services\\' transition grant have been based on the same principle, \\ndescribed above, but using your LHD\\'s projected average cost for patient level costing for Non \\nAdmitted Services (where available) against the State Price. \\n\\nCalculations for Sub-Acute and Mental Health - Admitted services\\' transition grants have been \\nbased on the same principle, described above. \\n\\nBlock Funded Hospitals \\n\\nThe calculation for Block Funded Hospitals\\' transition grant is the difference between the overall \\nfunding calculated for your LHD\\'s small hospitals, and the aggregate projected cost calculated \\nbased on your DNR for 2012/13 escalated. \\n\\nROW SECTION G — GROSS-UP (PRIVATE PATIENT SERVICE ADJUSTMENT) \\n\\nGross-Up (Private Patient Service Adjustments) is the calculated value of private patient \\nrevenue for accommodation and prostheses (which is included in the NWAU calculation as \\nnegative adjustment) and therefore needs to be added back to the LHD/SHN expense budget to \\nprovide the total ABF expense for the NWAU activity. \\n\\nGross-Up (Private Patient Service Adjustments) $ (000\\'s) \\n\\nAcute Admitted $20,964 \\n\\nSub-Acute Admitted $2,557 \\n\\nMental Health - Admitted (Acute and Sub-Acute) $567 \\n\\nTotal: $24,087 \\n\\nROW SECTION H — PROVISION FOR SPECIFIC INITIATIVES & TMF ADJUSTMENTS \\n\\nTreasury Managed Fund Benchmark (Budget) Adjustments \\n\\nThe Treasury Managed Fund provides workers compensation, motor vehicle and property \\nliability insurance cover for all reporting entities within NSW Health, including LHD/SHNs. \\n\\nEach year NSW Treasury sets an insurance benchmark budget for NSW Health which covers \\nall of the insurance policies (i.e. workers compensation etc) held on behalf of Districts and other \\nreporting entities. \\n\\nThe 2014/15 insurance TMF budget has resulted in a reduction for reporting entities within NSW \\nHealth.

CORE Values\\nAchieving the goals, directions and strategies for NSW Health requires clear and co-ordinated prioritisation of work programs, and supportive leadership that exemplifies the CORE Values of NSW Health:\\nCollaboration – we are committed to working collaboratively with each other to achieve the best possible outcomes for our patients who are at the centre of everything we do. In working collaboratively we acknowledge that every person working in the health system plays a valuable role that contributes to achieving the best possible outcomes.\\nOpenness – a commitment to openness in our communications builds confidence and greater cooperation. We are committed to encouraging our patients, and all people who work in the health system, to provide feedback that will help us provide better services.\\nRespect – we have respect for the abilities, knowledge, skills and achievements of all people who work in the health system. We are also committed to providing health services that acknowledge and respect the feelings, wishes and rights of our patients and their carers.\\nEmpowerment – in providing quality health care services we aim to ensure our patients are able to make well informed and confident decisions about their care and treatment. We further aim to create a sense of empowerment in the workplace for people to use their knowledge, skills and experience to provide the best possible care to patients, their families and carers.\\n3.

The results of the survey will be used to identify areas of both best practice and improvement opportunities, to determine how change can be affected at an individual, organisational and system level to improve workplace culture and practices.\\nThe Junior Medical Officer Your Training and Wellbeing Matters Survey will monitor the quality of supervision, education and training provided to junior medical officers and their welfare and wellbeing. The survey will also identify areas of best practice and further opportunities for improvement at an organisational and system level.\\nThe Australian Medical Association, in conjunction with the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Association, will undertake regular surveys of senior medical staff to assess clinical participation and involvement in local decision making to deliver patient centred care.\\n4. Legislation, Governance and Performance Framework\\n4.1 Legislation\\nThe Health Services Act 1997 (the Act) provides a legislative framework for the public health system, including setting out purposes and/or functions in relation to Local Health Districts (ss 8, 9, 10).\\nUnder the Act, the Health Secretary’s functions include: the facilitation of the achievement and maintenance of adequate standards of patient care within public hospitals, provision of governance, oversight and control of the public health system and the statutory health organisations within it, as well as in relation to other services provided by the public health system, and to facilitate the efficient and economic operation of the public health system (s.122).\\nThe Act allows the Health Secretary to enter into performance agreements with Local Health Districts in relation to the provision of health services and health support services (s.126). The performance agreement may include provisions of a service agreement.\\nUnder the Act the Minister may attach conditions to the payment of any subsidy (or part of any subsidy) (s.127). As a condition of subsidy all funding provided for specific purposes must be used for those purposes unless approved by the Health Secretary.\\n4.2 Variation of the Agreement\\nThe Agreement may be amended at any time by agreement in writing between the Organisation and the Ministry.\\nThe Agreement may also be varied by the Secretary or the Minister in exercise of their general powers under the Act, including determination of the role, functions and activities of Local Health Districts (s. 32).\\nAny updates to finance or activity information further to the original contents of the Agreement will be provided through separate documents that may be issued by the Ministry in the course of the year.\\n4.3 National Agreement - Hospital funding and health reform\\nThe Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has reaffirmed that providing universal health care for all Australians is a shared priority and agreed in a Heads of Agreement for public hospitals funding from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2020. That Agreement maintains activity based funding and the national efficient price. There is a focus on improved patient safety, quality of services and reduced unnecessary hospitalisations. ',\n",
       "                'The Commonwealth will continue its focus on reforms in primary care that are designed to improve patient outcomes and reduce avoidable hospital admissions. See http://www.coag.gov.au/agreements\\n4.4 Governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure that all applicable duties, obligations and accountabilities are understood and complied with, and that services are provided in a manner consistent with all NSW Health policies, procedures, plans, circulars, inter-agency agreements, Ministerial directives and other instruments and statutory obligations.\\nThe Organisation is to ensure\\nTimely implementation of Coroner’s findings and recommendations, as well as recommendations of Root Cause Analyses\\nActive participation in state-wide reviews\\n4.4.1 Clinical Governance\\nNSW public health services are accredited against the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards.\\nhttps://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/our-work/assessment-to-the-nsqhs-standards/nsqhs- standards-second-edition/\\nThe Australian Safety and Quality Framework for Health Care provides a set of guiding principles that can assist Health Services with their clinical governance obligations. https://www.safetyandquality.gov.au/national-priorities/australian-safety-and-quality- framework-for-health-care/\\nThe NSW Patient Safety and Clinical Quality Program provides an important framework for improvements to clinical quality.\\nhttp://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/ActivePDSDocuments/PD2005_608.pdf\\n4.4.2 Corporate Governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure services are delivered in a manner consistent with the NSW Health Corporate Governance and Accountability Compendium (the Compendium) seven corporate governance standards. The Compendium is at:\\nhttp://www.health.nsw.gov.au/policies/manuals/pages/corporate-governance- compendium.aspx\\nWhere applicable, the Organisation is to:\\nProvide required reports in accordance with timeframes advised by the Ministry;\\n. Review and update the Manual of Delegations (PD2012_059) to ensure currency;\\n. Ensure recommendations of the NSW Auditor-General, the Public Accounts Committee and the NSW Ombudsman, where accepted by NSW Health, are actioned in a timely and effective manner, and that repeat audit issues are avoided.\\n\\n4.4.3 Procurement Governance\\nThe Organisation must ensure procurement of goods and services complies with the NSW Health Procurement Policy, the key policy governing procurement practices for all NSW Health organisations. The NSW Health Procurement Policy is to be applied in conjunction with procedures detailed in the NSW Health Goods and Services Procurement Policy Directive (PD2018_030). These documents detail the requirements of all staff undertaking procurement or disposal of goods and services on behalf of NSW Health. -\\nhttps://www1.health.nsw.gov.au/pds/Pages/doc.aspx?dn=PD2018_030\\n4.4.4 Safety and Quality Accounts\\nThe Organisation will complete a Safety and Quality Account to document achievements, and affirm an ongoing commitment to improving and integrating safety and quality into their functions. The Account provides information about the safety and quality of care delivered by the Organisation, including key state-wide mandatory measures, patient safety priorities, service improvements, integration initiatives, and three additional locally selected high priority measures. Locally selected high priority measures must demonstrate a holistic approach to safety and quality, and at least one of these must focus on improving safety and quality for Aboriginal patients.\\nThe Account must also demonstrate how the Organisation meets Standard 1. Clinical Governance, of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which describes the clinical governance, and safety and quality systems that are required to maintain and improve the reliability, safety and quality of health care, and improve health outcomes for patients. Standard 1 ensures that frontline clinicians, managers and members of governing bodies, such as boards, are accountable to patients and the community for assuring the delivery of health services that are safe, effective, integrated, high quality and continuously improving.\\nConsistent with the National Health Reform Agreement, The Organisation must continue to focus on reducing the incidence of hospital acquired complications. Through the Purchasing Framework, NSW Health has incentivised Districts and Networks to invest in quality improvement initiatives that specifically target these complications. It is expected that the Safety and Quality Account articulates these initiatives and provides details on approaches and outcomes.\\n4.4.5 Performance Framework\\nService Agreements are a central component of the NSW Health Performance Framework, which documents how the Ministry monitors and assesses the performance of public sector health services to achieve expected service levels, financial performance, governance and other requirements.\\n',\n",
       "                'The performance of a Health Service is assessed on whether the organisation is meeting the strategic objectives for NSW Health and government, the Premier’s priorities and performance against key performance indicators. The availability and implementation of governance structures and processes, and whether there has been a significant critical incident or sentinel event also influences the assessment.\\nThe Framework sets out performance improvement approaches, responses to performance concerns and management processes that support the achievement of outcomes in accordance with NSW Health and government policies and priorities.\\nPerformance concerns will be raised with the Organisation for focused discussion at performance review meetings in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework available at: http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Performance/Pages/frameworks.aspx\\nSchedule A: Strategies and Priorities\\nThe delivery of NSW Health strategies and priorities is the responsibility of the Ministry, NSW Health Services and Support Organisations. These are to be reflected in the strategic, operational and business plans of these entities.\\nNSW Government Priorities\\nThe NSW Government has outlined their priorities for their third term:\\nBuilding a strong economy\\n· · · · · Providing high-quality education\\nCreating well connected communities\\nProviding world class customer service\\nTackling longstanding social challenges\\nNSW Health will contribute to the NSW Government’s priorities in a number of ways:\\nOur focus and commitment to put the patient at the centre of all that we do will continue and be expanded.\\nWe will continue to deliver new and improved health infrastructure and digital solutions that connect communities and improve quality of life for people in rural, regional and metropolitan areas.\\nWe will help develop solutions to tackle longstanding social challenges including intergenerational disadvantage, suicide and indigenous disadvantage.\\nNSW Health staff will continue to work together to deliver a sustainable health system that delivers outcomes that matter to patients and community, is personalised, invests in wellness and is digitally enabled.\\nElection Commitments\\nNSW Health is responsible for the delivery of 50 election commitments over the period to March 2023. The Ministry of Health will lead the delivery of these commitments with support from Health Services and Support Organisations.\\nMinister’s Priority\\nNSW Health will strive for engagement, empathy and excellence to promote a positive and compassionate culture that is shared by managers, front-line clinical and support staff alike. This culture will ensure the delivery of safe, appropriate, high quality care for our patients and communities. To do this, Health Services are to continue to effectively engage with the community, and ensure that managers at all levels are visible and working collaboratively with staff, patients and carers within their organisation, service or unit. These requirements will form a critical element of the Safety and Quality Account.\\n\\nNSW State Health Plan: Towards 2021\\nThe NSW State Health Plan: Towards 2021 provides a strategic framework which brings together NSW Health’s existing plans, programs and policies and sets priorities across the system for the delivery of the right care, in the right place, at the right time. See http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/statehealthplan/Publications/NSW-state-health-plan-towards- 2021.pdf 1\\nNSW Health Strategic Priorities 2019-20\\nValue based healthcare\\nValue based healthcare (VBHC) is a framework for organising health systems around the concept of value. In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care\\nthat improves:\\nThe health outcomes that matter to patients\\nThe experience of receiving care\\nThe experience of providing care\\nThe effectiveness and efficiency of care\\nVBHC builds on our long-held emphasis on safety and quality by increasing the focus on delivering health outcomes and the experience of receiving care as defined from the patient perspective; systematically measuring outcomes (rather than outputs) and using insights to further inform resource allocation decisions; and a more integrated approach across the full cycle of care.\\nImproving patient experience\\nConsistent with NSW Government priorities to improve customers experience for NSW residents, NSW Health is committed to enhancing patients and their carer’s experience of care. A structured approach to patient experience that supports a cohesive, strategic and measurable approach is being progressed. An audit in 2018 of initiatives underway across the NSW Health system identified 260 initiatives across districts, networks and pillar organisations to enhance the patient experience.\\nIn 2019-20, the Ministry of Health will work closely with Health Services and Support Organisations to progress the strategic approach to improving patient experience across the NSW public health system.\\n',\n",

Strategic Deliverables\\nValue based healthcare\\nValue based healthcare (VBHC) is a framework for organising health systems around the concept of value. In NSW value based healthcare means continually striving to deliver care that improves:\\nThe health outcomes that matter to patients\\nThe experience of receiving care · · · The experience of providing care\\nThe effectiveness and efficiency of care\\nVBHC builds on our long-held emphasis on safety and quality by increasing the focus on delivering health outcomes and the experience of receiving care as defined from the patient perspective; systematically measuring outcomes (rather than outputs) and using insights to further inform resource allocation decisions; and a more integrated approach across the full cycle of care.\\nLeading Better Value Care, Commissioning for Better Value and Integrating Care are three programs helping to accelerate NSW Health’s move to value based healthcare.\\nIntegrating Care\\n',\n",
       "                'In 2019-20 the Ministry of Health has reinvigorated Integrating Care (IC) with a focus on scaling five locally developed initiatives which will benefit patients and the system across NSW. The five scaled initiatives are evidence-based and show benefits in line with the Quadruple Aim. They have been selected because they demonstrate integration throughout the NSW Health system, and with Primary Health Networks and other clusters.\\nThe main roles and responsibilities in the IC Program are:\\nThe Ministry of Health will continue as system manager and will articulate the priorities for NSW Health. Performance against delivery of the priorities will be monitored in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework.\\nDistricts and Networks will determine local approaches to implement and deliver at least one of the five Ministry selected IC initiatives in 2019-20. Districts and Networks may also continue to provide services established through IC in 2017-18 and 2018-19 if deemed viable and locally appropriate to do so.\\nThe Pillars, in discussion with the Ministry, may support Districts and Networks in a flexible manner that can be customised to meet state-wide and local needs, primarily to support implementation and clinical redesign for the IC initiatives.\\nDistricts and Networks will provide patient-level data to the Ministry of Health to assist evaluation, monitoring and regular reporting of the IC initiatives at a local and state-wide level.\\nThe Ministry will hold patient-level IC data and use existing linkage and de-identification processes to support comprehensive measurement of the initiatives as required.\\nIn 2019-20, Districts and Networks will:\\nWork with the Ministry of Health to implement at least one of the 2019-20 IC initiatives:\\no ED to Community (EDC)\\n- IC EDC is an intensive case management approach for people who present to a hospital’s Emergency Department ten times or more in a twelve month period.\\n- These people are likely to have multiple complex and chronic care needs.\\no Paediatrics Network (PN)\\n- IC PN is a care approach that enables children with complex needs to receive care closer to home where possible and appropriate, while also receiving specialist care where required.\\n- Through upskilling local services, and enablers such as telehealth, children and families can reduce travel time and receive coordinated care.\\no\\nResidential Aged Care (RAC)\\n- IC RAC recognises that outcomes for people living in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACF) could be improved during periods of illness.\\n- Through enabling people to be cared for at their place of residence, where appropriate, rather than unnecessary transfer to hospital, patient experience and outcomes can be enhanced.\\no Specialist Outreach to Primary Care (SPC)\\n- IC SPC initiative aims to optimise patient care in the community through collaboration between primary care and secondary care clinicians.\\n- Identified patients are included in a structured care coordination program to enable appropriate care if they attend hospital, and while in the community.\\no Vulnerable Families (VF\\n- IC VF is an intensive care coordination intervention for families where the parents or carers have complex health and social needs, and who have at least one child unborn to 17 years of age.\\n- The cohort are likely to experience barriers to engagement with the health system and other social services including Education and Family and Community Services, and often have multiple complex conditions.\\nContinue to implement, expand and embed implementation of the Integrated Care for People with Chronic Conditions (ICPCC) initiative to support people who are identified as being at risk of a future hospital admission.\\nContinue to provide and expand the reach of clinical services in the most appropriate care setting for existing IC patients.\\nParticipate in and provide data to inform monitoring, evaluation and other studies of IC initiatives.\\nUtilise their IC teams to support the implementation, collection and use of identified Patient Reported Measures and work with other district resources to support the broader work program to embed IC approaches in the district.\\nBe expected to demonstrate improved health outcomes (clinical and patient reported), experiences and possible activity benefits from implemented IC initiatives in their district.\\nData for all Integrated Care patients should be captured in the Patient Flow Portal (PFP). This tool is already available for Integrated Care for People with Chronic Conditions, and additional modules will become available for all other Integrated Care initiatives. This will improve data capture, and minimise the reporting burden for each LHD and SHN.\\nLeading Better Value Care\\nThe Leading Better Value Care (LBVC) Program identifies and scales evidence-based initiatives for specific diseases or conditions and supports their implementation in all local health districts across the state. ',\n",

Performance against delivery of the priorities will be monitored in line with the NSW Health Performance Framework.\\nDistricts and Networks will continue to provide services established through LBVC in 2017-18 and 2018-19 and determine local approaches to deliver new LBVC initiatives in 2019-20.\\nThe Pillars will continue to support Districts and Networks in a flexible manner that can be customised to meet statewide and local needs and will support measurement activities as required.\\n\\nDistricts and Networks will participate with Ministry of Health and Pillars in evaluation, monitoring and regular reporting on the progress of the LBVC initiatives as specified in the Monitoring and Evaluation Plans.\\nIn 2019-20, districts and networks will:\\nContinue to provide and expand the reach of clinical services in the most appropriate care setting for patients in LBVC Tranche 1 initiatives of Osteoporotic Refracture Prevention (ORP), Osteoarthritis Chronic Care Program (OACCP), Renal Supportive Care (RSC) and High Risk Foot Services (HRFS) through non-admitted services, including designated HERO clinics.\\nContinue to implement, expand and embed LBVC approaches, including but not limited to a focus on activities outlined in Clinical Improvement Activity Briefs for Chronic Heart Failure (CHF), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Inpatient Management of Diabetes.\\nContinue to sustain improvement work and spread when interventions are reliably practiced to reduce falls and harm from falls in hospital. Districts should have a Sustainability Action Plan (including actions on how to progress implementation endorsed by the district Executive) to identify opportunities and risks to sustaining and spreading the Falls in Hospital Collaborative improvements.\\nParticipate in and provide data to inform monitoring, evaluation and other studies of LBVC initiatives.\\nUtilise their PRMs Project Officer to support the implementation, collection and use of identified Patient Reported Measures and work with other district resources to support the broader work program to embed value-based healthcare approaches in the district.\\nBe expected to demonstrate improved health outcomes (clinical and patient reported), experiences and activity benefits from all Tranche 1 initiatives as outlined in the monitoring and evaluation plans.\\nWork with the Ministry of Health and Pillar agencies to implement LBVC Tranche 2 initiatives for:\\no Bronchiolitis: Implement and embed LBVC approaches as outlined in the Clinical Improvement Activity Brief for the Bronchiolitis initiative including:\\n- Appropriate investigations for Bronchiolitis, including Paediatrician medical review\\n- Implement guidelines for the appropriate use of oxygen and antibiotics\\n- Develop consistent advice on safe home management for families\\no Hip Fracture: Implement and embed LBVC approaches to meet the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care Hip Fracture Care Clinical Standards, with a particular focus on activities outlined in the Clinical Improvement Activity Brief for the Hip Fracture Care initiative including:\\n- Pain management assessments upon presentation\\n- Reduce time to surgery to less than 48 hours\\n- Early mobilisation and weight bearing\\n- Implementation of an orthogeriatric model of care\\no Direct Access Colonoscopy for Positive Faecal Occult Blood Test (+FOBT)\\n- By December 2019 develop a plan for the implementation of direct access colonoscopy for +FOBT across the district by June 2021\\n- Beginning in January 2020, implement Clinical Categorisation Guidelines for the booking of colonoscopy waiting lists\\n- By December 2019, commence quarterly reporting on the number of colonoscopies performed as a result of +FOBT.\\n- By June 2020, establish direct access for +FOBT referrals in at least one new public colonoscopy facility in the district, including collaboration with the PHN to update health pathways.\\n- By June 2020 be ready to commence quarterly reporting of wait times for colonoscopy in public facilities by triage category and referral type and have a plan for ongoing quality assurance of waitlists.\\no Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Early Stage Breast Cancer\\n- Regularly collect, provide, and report on key data items in alignment with the initiative’s Monitoring and Evaluation Plan; providing quarterly and annual updates.\\n- By September 2019 perform a self-assessment of current hypofractionated radiotherapy utilisation for the treatment of early stage breast cancer; identifying gaps in utilisation\\n',\n",

Commissioning is a process of considering the outcomes that need to be achieved, and designing, implementing and managing a system to deliver these in the most effective way. CBV reflects NSW Health’s commitment to refocus our services from volume (outputs) to value (outcomes).\\nOutputs are designed around the amount of activity being provided. Outcomes are designed around the person receiving the service. Outcomes are the difference the project can make to improve the:\\nhealth outcomes that matter to patients\\npatient experience of receiving care\\nclinician experience of providing care\\neffectiveness and efficiency of care\\nCommissioning for better value is already being applied by some districts and networks in clinical support and non-clinical service design, process improvements and procurement.\\nMore information is available from http://internal.health.nsw.gov.au/vbhc/commissioning.html. The main roles and responsibilities in the CBV program are:\\nDistricts and Networks will use commissioning-based principles and tools to make clinical support and non-clinical projects more impactful for patients, clinicians and other users.\\nThe Ministry of Health will support the implementation of the NSW Government Commissioning and Contestability Policy and develop guidance and tools to support Districts and Networks.\\nIn 2019-20, Districts and Networks will apply a commissioning approach to non-clinical services by considering the outcomes that need to be achieved.\\n\\n'],\n",
