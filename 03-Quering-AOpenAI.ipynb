The embedding is an information dense representation of the semantic meaning of a piece of text. Each embedding is a vector of floating point numbers, such that the distance between two embeddings in the vector space is correlated with semantic similarity between two inputs in the original format. For example, if two texts are similar, then their vector representations should also be similar. \n",

The objective is to avoid vectorizing all documents at the time of ingestion (Option 3). Instead, we can vectorize the chunks as users search for or discover documents. This approach ensures that we allocate funds and resources only when the documents are actually required. Typically, in an organization with a vast repository of documents in a data lake, only 20% of the documents are frequently accessed, while the rest remain untouched.

It should be read in conjunction \\n\\nwith BLS, ALS and Paediatric guidelines. \\n\\nWho does this guideline apply to? \\n\\nThis guideline applies to adults and children who require advanced life support (ALS) in an \\n\\nin-hospital environment. \\n\\nWho is the audience for this guideline? \\n\\nThis guideline is for health care professionals in hospital environments where equipment and \\n\\nmedications are available. \\n\\nRecommendations \\n\\nThe Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) recommends that:  \\n\\n1.  As soon as possible, Advanced Life Support treatments are used to supplement the care of \\n\\nany patient receiving Basic Life Support.  \\n\\n2.  Hospitals use early warning, rapid response team, or medical emergency team systems to \\n\\nreduce the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrests, and in-hospital mortality, and to treat \\n\\npatient deterioration.  \\n\\n3.  Hospitals use a system validated for their specific patient population to identify \\n\\nindividuals at increased risk of serious clinical deterioration, cardiac arrest, or death, both \\n\\non admission to hospital and during their stay.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSystems should ensure: \\n\\n \\n\\n• clinical deterioration is recognised early to prevent cardiac arrest; \\n\\n• cardiorespiratory arrest is recognised immediately; \\n\\n• help is summoned using a specific telephone number/call system; \\n\\n• CPR is started immediately and, if indicated, defibrillation is attempted as soon as \\n\\npossible (ideally within 3 min). \\n\\n \\n\\n TN AUSTRALIAN RESUSCITATION COUNCIL \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 2 of 22 \\n\\nGuideline \\n\\n  Guideline Process \\n\\nThis guideline updates Guideline 11.1, incorporates the previous Guideline 11.1.1 \\n\\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Advanced Life Support Providers, and includes new \\n\\nmaterial related to in-hospital resuscitation partly based on the Resuscitation Council (UK) \\n\\nIn-hospital resuscitation document.1 This guideline includes evidence from the 2015 ILCOR \\n\\nreview process using GRADE methodology and the NHMRC methodology used in the \\n\\nprevious Guideline 11.1.1. The guideline process includes involvement of stakeholders from \\n\\nall member organisations of the ARC, and peer review by the Australian Resuscitation \\n\\nCouncil and their Executive Committee. Details of the guidelines development process can be \\n\\nfound on the ARC website https://resus.org.au  \\n\\n Summary of changes \\n\\nCombines previous Guidelines 11.1 and 11.1.1 with the addition of further information on \\n\\nprinciples of in-hospital resuscitation. \\n\\n Introduction \\n\\nThis guideline is aimed primarily at health care professionals who are likely to be the first to \\n\\nrespond to an in-hospital cardiac arrest or significant clinical deterioration.  It may also be \\n\\napplicable to healthcare professionals working in other clinical settings. The ARC document \\n\\nStandards for Resuscitation: Clinical Practice and Education supports the implementation of \\n\\nthis guideline. https://resus.org.au/standards-for-resuscitation-clinical-practice-and-education  \\n\\nExcept where specified, the advice is the same for infants (other than newborns) and children \\n\\nas it is for adults.  \\n\\n Prevention of Cardiac Arrest      \\n\\nChildren and young adults presenting with characteristic symptoms of arrhythmic syncope \\n\\nshould have a specialist cardiology assessment, which should include an ECG and in most \\n\\ncases an echocardiogram and exercise test.2 [Class A, Expert consensus opinion]  \\n\\n \\n\\nCharacteristics of arrhythmic syncope include: syncope in the supine position, occurring \\n\\nduring or after exercise, with no or only brief prodromal symptoms, repetitive episodes, or in \\n\\nindividuals with a family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD). In addition, non-pleuritic \\n\\nchest pain, palpitations associated with syncope, seizures (when resistant to treatment, or \\n\\noccurring at night) should raise suspicion of increased risk of arrhythmic syncope. Systematic \\n\\nevaluation in a clinic specialising in the care of those at risk for SCD is recommended in \\n\\nfamily members of young victims of SCD or those with a known cardiac disorder resulting in \\n\\nan increased risk of SCD.2 [Class B; Expert consensus opinion] \\n\\n In-Hospital Pre-Arrest Detection and Management  \\n\\nIn adult patients admitted to hospital, there is variable evidence regarding the use of early \\n\\nwarning systems/rapid response team (RRT) systems or medical emergency team (MET) \\n\\nhttps://resus.org.au/\\nhttps://resus.org.au/standards-for-resuscitation-clinical-practice-and-education\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 3 of 22 \\n\\nsystems (compared with no such systems) to reduce cardiac and respiratory arrests and \\n\\nhospital mortality.2  \\n\\n \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'ARC suggests that hospitals consider the introduction of an early warning score \\n\\nEWS/response team/MET system to reduce the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) \\n\\nand in-hospital mortality (CoSTR 2015 weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).3 It is \\n\\nreasonable, and increasingly mandated by health authorities, that hospitals provide a system \\n\\nof care that includes2,4 : \\n\\n  \\n\\n•  staff education about the signs of patient deterioration;  \\n\\n•  appropriate and regular vital signs monitoring of patients;  \\n\\n•  clear guidance (e.g. via calling criteria or early warning scores) to assist staff in the early \\n\\ndetection   of patient deterioration;  \\n\\n•  a clear, uniform system of calling for assistance, and;  \\n\\n•  a clinical response to calls for assistance.  \\n\\n[Class A; Expert consensus opinion] \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to identify the best methods for the delivery of these \\n\\ncomponents, and on current evidence, this should be based on local circumstances.2, 4 [Class \\n\\nA; Expert consensus opinion]  Hospitals should use a system validated for their specific \\n\\npatient population to identify individuals at increased risk of serious clinical deterioration, \\n\\ncardiac arrest, or death, both on admission and during hospital stay.2 [Class A; Expert \\n\\nconsensus opinion].  \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to identify specific educational strategies that improve \\n\\noutcomes (e.g. early recognition and rescue of deteriorating patient at risk of \\n\\ncardiac/respiratory arrest). Educational efforts have a positive impact on knowledge, skills, \\n\\nattitudes and confidence, and increase the frequency of activation of a response and should \\n\\ntherefore be considered.2 [Class A; Expert consensus opinion]. \\n\\n The importance of BLS \\n\\nBLS is only a temporary measure to maintain ventilation and circulation. Effective chest \\n\\ncompression provides a cardiac output of only 20-30% of the pre-arrest value 5, and rescue \\n\\nbreathing without supplemental oxygen provides ventilation with an inspired oxygen \\n\\nconcentration of only 15%.2,6 Electrical defibrillation is the mainstay of treatment for \\n\\nventricular fibrillation and pulseless VT. The chance of successful defibrillation decreases \\n\\nwith time. Therefore high quality CPR and decreasing the time to defibrillation are the first \\n\\npriorities in resuscitation from cardiac arrest. The purpose of BLS is to help maintain \\n\\nmyocardial and cerebral oxygenation until ALS personnel and equipment are available:  \\n\\n•  effective BLS may increase the likelihood of successful defibrillation.7  \\n\\n•  effective BLS buys time until reversible causes can be diagnosed and/or treated.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMonitoring CPR quality and resuscitation performance is an important element of Basic and \\n\\nAdvanced Life Support and includes:  \\n\\n \\n\\n•  effectiveness of compressions (adequacy of depth, rate and minimising hands off periods);  \\n\\n•  adequacy of ventilation (avoiding over-ventilation and consequent deleterious effects);  \\n\\n•  timing of defibrillation with regard to likelihood of success (as soon as possible and \\n\\nproviding compressions before and after).  \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 4 of 22 \\n\\nPatient care during the pre-arrest period (early detection and prevention of cardiac arrest) \\n\\nand the post-resuscitation management are also vital to improving patient outcomes.  \\n\\nAn extensive review of many aspects of advanced life support was performed as part of the \\n\\n2010 and 2015 Consensus on Science process.8-14 The information from this process has been \\n\\nincorporated into the guidelines wherever appropriate. \\n\\nAfter in-hospital cardiac arrest the division between Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced \\n\\nLife Support (ALS) is arbitrary; in practice, the resuscitation process is a continuum but BLS \\n\\nand ALS are specifically defined in the ARC Glossary. For all in-hospital cardiac arrests, \\n\\nensure: \\n\\n•  cardiorespiratory arrest is recognised immediately; \\n\\n•  help is summoned using a specific telephone number/call system; \\n\\n•  CPR is started immediately and, if indicated, defibrillation is attempted as soon as \\n\\npossible (ideally within 3 min). \\n\\nAll in-hospital cardiac arrests should be reviewed as part of an audit and quality \\n\\nimprovement process. Details should be recorded after each event.  \\n\\n7 Sequence for a patient in need of resuscitation in \\nhospital \\n\\nActions for health care professionals attending a collapsed patient in need of resuscitation in \\n\\nhospital are summarised in the following algorithm: Figure 1. \\n\\n \\n\\nRRT: Rapid Response Team \\n\\n Collapsed Patient Send for help and rapidly assess Unresponsive and not breathing If breathing normally or normally - start CPR and call RRT responsive - rapid assessment of ABCDE, check glucose, apply monitors, oxygen and IV access Attach defibrillator and follow Call RRT if appropriate BLS and ALS algorithms Handover and assist RRT Handover and assist RRT \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 5 of 22 \\n\\n',\n",
       "                '7.1 Personal safety and protective equipment \\n\\nThe personal safety of all individuals involved in resuscitation is paramount. While there are \\n\\nvery few reports of harm to rescuers during resuscitation the following principles should \\n\\napply: \\n\\n• always check that the environment and patient surroundings are safe before proceeding. \\n\\n• put on personal protective equipment (PPE) as soon as possible and as appropriate to the \\n\\npatient’s clinical status. Local infection control policies should be followed.  \\n\\n• all sharps should be handled with care and disposed of in a sharps container which \\n\\nshould be immediately available. Staff are responsible for the safe disposal of sharps they \\n\\nhave used. \\n\\n• safe manual handling techniques according to local policies should be used when moving \\n\\npatients during resuscitation, to protect both patients and staff.  \\n\\n• staff are clear of patient while shocks are delivered or the defibrillator is disarmed, prior to \\n\\nrecommencement of chest compressions. \\n\\n7.2 Checking the patient for a response \\n\\nFollowing a witnessed collapse or finding a collapsed patient, assess for response (ANZCOR \\n\\nGuideline 3).  If other members of staff are nearby it will be possible to undertake several \\n\\nactions simultaneously. \\n\\n7.3   If the patient responds \\n\\nThe patient will still require urgent medical assessment, so send for help according to local \\n\\nprotocols. This usually involves calling a Rapid Response Team (e.g. Medical Emergency \\n\\nTeam (MET)).  \\n\\nRapidly assess the patient using the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure \\n\\n(ABCDE) approach including check blood glucose level, applying monitors (pulse oximeter, \\n\\nECG, blood pressure), giving oxygen if indicated and obtaining IV or intraosseous (IO) \\n\\naccess. Use the pulse oximeter to guide oxygen therapy (see Guideline 11.6.1 Targeted oxygen \\n\\ntherapy in adult advanced life support). Record vital signs and other assessments, addressing \\n\\nabnormalities according to the abilities of those responding, and prepare to handover to the \\n\\nRapid Response Team using the ISBAR (Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment, \\n\\nRecommendation) framework. \\n\\n7.4   If the patient does not respond \\n\\nSend for help as assistance will be needed immediately, and assess response, airway and \\n\\nbreathing according to ANZCOR BLS Flowchart (ANZCOR Guideline 8) then follow the \\n\\nANZCOR Advanced Life Support Guideline 11.2.  \\n\\nTurn the patient onto their back and open the airway using head tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust \\n\\nmanoeuvres. If there is a risk of cervical spine injury, jaw thrust or chin lift is preferred to \\n\\nhead tilt but a patent airway, oxygenation and ventilation takes priority over concerns about \\n\\npotential cervical spine injury. \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 6 of 22 \\n\\nKeeping the airway open, look, listen, and feel to determine if the patient is breathing \\n\\nnormally. This should take less than 10 seconds and involves: \\n\\nLooking for chest movement (breathing or coughing) \\n\\nListening at the patient’s mouth for breath sounds \\n\\nFeeling air movement on your hand/cheek \\n\\nLooking for other movement or signs of life \\n\\nIf the adult patient is not responsive and not breathing normally, commence chest \\n\\ncompressions (see ANZCOR Guideline 6). For children, CPR by advanced life support \\n\\nproviders should commence with 2 ventilations before starting chest compressions (see \\n\\nANZCOR Guideline 12.2). If trained and experienced in assessment of circulation in \\n\\ncollapsed patients: check for breathing and a central pulse at the same time. If there is any \\n\\nquestion over the presence or absence of a pulse it must be treated as if it were absent. Delays \\n\\nin diagnosing cardiac arrest and starting CPR will adversely affect chances of survival and \\n\\nmust be avoided, so if there is any doubt, commence CPR. Chest compressions in a patient \\n\\nwho is collapsed, unresponsive and not breathing normally, and whose heart is still beating \\n\\nare unlikely to cause harm. \\n\\nAgonal breaths (occasional, irregular gasps) are common in the early stages of cardiac arrest \\n\\nand are a sign of cardiac arrest. Agonal breathing and limb movement can also occur during \\n\\neffective chest compressions as cerebral perfusion improves, but are not indicative of a return \\n\\nof spontaneous circulation (ROSC). \\n\\nChanges in skin colour (e.g. pallor, cyanosis) in isolation are not diagnostic of cardiac arrest. \\n\\nGet resuscitation equipment and attach a defibrillator. If you are alone, you will need to leave \\n\\nthe patient temporarily to get equipment. If the patient is already attached to monitoring in a \\n\\ncritical care area this will facilitate rapid assessment but does not negate the need for clinical \\n\\nassessment. \\n\\nCommence 30 chest compressions followed by 2 ventilations, and continue with a ratio of \\n\\n30:2. For children, after initial 2 ventilations, continue with 15 chest compressions followed by \\n\\n2 ventilations (a ratio of 15:2).  \\n\\n',\n",
       "                \"The hand position for chest compression is the middle of the lower half of the sternum. This \\n\\nhand position can be found quickly by teaching placement of the heel of one hand in the \\n\\ncentre of the chest with the other hand on top, and demonstrating placing hands in the \\n\\nmiddle of the lower half of the sternum. In smaller children, one hand may be sufficient to \\n\\nprovide adequate compression depth. A two-thumb technique is preferred for delivering \\n\\ncompressions to an infant. \\n\\nEnsure high quality chest compressions: \\n\\n• depth of >5 cm (adult). In children, compression depth should be approximately 1/3 the \\n\\nantero-posterior (AP) diameter of the chest (4cm in infants, 5cm in children). \\n\\n• rate of 100–120 compressions min \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 7 of 22 \\n\\n• allow the chest to recoil completely after each compression \\n\\n• take approximately the same amount of time for compression and relaxation \\n\\n• minimise any interruptions to chest compression (hands-off time) \\n\\nAfter ventilations, resume compressions without delay. \\n\\nEquipment should be immediately available in clinical areas to manage the airway and assist \\n\\nwith ventilation (e.g. a Pocket resuscitation mask, self-inflating bag-mask, or a supraglottic \\n\\nairway device and bag). \\n\\nThere may be reasons to avoid mouth-to-mouth ventilation in the clinical setting, but there \\n\\nmay be situations where giving mouth-to-mouth ventilation could be lifesaving (e.g. when \\n\\nthere is a delay in resuscitation equipment arriving or in non-clinical settings). If there are \\n\\ngood clinical reasons to avoid mouth-to-mouth, or if the responder is unable to do it, they \\n\\nshould concentrate on performing continuous chest compressions until more experienced \\n\\nhelp or airway equipment arrives.  \\n\\nUse an inspiratory time of about 1 second and give enough volume to cause the chest to \\n\\nvisibly rise. \\n\\nAvoid rapid or forceful breaths, and add supplemental oxygen as soon as possible. \\n\\nSupraglottic airway placement and tracheal intubation should be attempted only by those \\n\\nwho are trained, competent and experienced in the skill. Attempts to secure an airway should \\n\\noccur with minimal interruptions (less than 5 seconds) to chest compressions. \\n\\nQuantitative capnography (ideally waveform) must be used routinely to confirm tracheal \\n\\ntube placement, and should also be used with a supraglottic airway, and continued during \\n\\nCPR. Waveform capnography also allows assessment of the quality of CPR, provides an \\n\\nindication of ROSC and helps determining prognosis during CPR (ANZCOR Guideline 11.6). \\n\\nAfter an advanced airway (supraglottic airway/tracheal tube) is placed during CPR, it is \\n\\nreasonable to ventilate the lungs at a rate of 6 to 10 ventilations per minute without pausing \\n\\nduring chest compressions to deliver ventilations (ANZCOR Guideline 11.6).  \\n\\nAs soon as an automated external defibrillator (AED) arrives, follow the prompts that will \\n\\nguide use. \\n\\n  \\n\\nFor a manual defibrillator apply the self-adhesive pads to the patient's chest whilst chest \\n\\ncompressions continue, and charge the defibrillator.

Compared with BLS providers, ALS providers \\n\\nare more likely to have performed and practised CPR. Despite this, observational studies of \\n\\nthe actual performance of CPR by heath care professionals have revealed inadequate depth of \\n\\ncompressions,15 excessive ventilation rates,16 and excessive interruptions to external cardiac \\n\\ncompressions.17 The general principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation remain the same for \\n\\nALS providers as for BLS providers: provide good quality compressions, minimise \\n\\ninterruptions to compressions, fill the lungs with oxygen, and provide ventilation but avoid \\n\\nexcessive ventilation.  \\n\\nHealth care professionals should be trained to provide CPR with 30 chest compressions and 2 \\n\\nventilations for adult patients (15:2 in children) in cardiac arrest. Performing chest \\n\\ncompressions alone is reasonable for trained individuals if they are unable to deliver \\n\\nventilations to cardiac arrest patients.2 \\n\\nThe risk of disease transmission is very low and initiating rescue breathing without a barrier \\n\\ndevice is reasonable.

CPR should not be delayed or withheld if PPE is not \\n\\navailable unless there is a clear risk to the rescuer.2 There are few reports of psychological \\n\\nharm to rescuers after being involved in a resuscitation attempt. There is insufficient evidence \\n\\nto support or refute any recommendation on minimizing the incidence of psychological harm \\n\\nto rescuers.2 \\n\\n8.1 When to Commence CPR \\n\\nThe sequence of events for BLS is the same for ALS providers (see ANZCOR Guideline 8). If \\n\\nthe adult patient is not responsive, the airway should be cleared and breathing assessed, and \\n\\nif the patient is not breathing normally, then CPR should be commenced with 30 chest \\n\\ncompressions followed by 2 ventilations. In children, the same assessment sequence should \\n\\nbe followed but advanced life support providers deliver ventilation prior to chest \\n\\ncompressions. \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nIt is reasonable that lay rescuers and health care professionals commence CPR in patients \\n\\nwho are unresponsive and not breathing normally.10 A pulse check (even in the hands of \\n\\nhealthcare professionals) has limitations18 but if an ALS provider is trained in that technique \\n\\nthey can also check for a central pulse (e.g. carotid) for up to 10 seconds during the period of \\n\\nassessment for signs of life [Class A; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion]. \\n\\nPalpation of the pulse as the sole indicator of the presence or absence of cardiac arrest is \\n\\nunreliable.

       "                'when the dominant hand was in contact with the sternum.19 The desired compression point \\n\\nfor CPR in adults is over the lower half of the sternum. Compressions provided higher than \\n\\nthis becomes less effective, and compressions lower than this are less effective and have an \\n\\nincreased risk of damage to intra-abdominal organs.  Two techniques were previously taught \\n\\nto find the correct compression point (e.g. calliper method and alternative method) however \\n\\nthere were shorter pauses between ventilations and compressions if the hands were simply \\n\\npositioned ‘in the centre of the chest’.19  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nFor chest compressions, it is recommended that rescuers place their hands on the lower half \\n\\nof the sternum. It is recommended to teach this location in a simplified way, such as, ‘place \\n\\nthe heel of your hand in the centre of the chest with the other hand on top.’ This instruction \\n\\nshould be accompanied by a demonstration of placing the hands on the lower half of the \\n\\nsternum. Use of the inter-nipple line as a landmark for hand placement is not reliable.10 [Class \\n\\nA; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\n8.3 Depth of Compression \\n\\nDespite ALS training and regular practice, in both out-of-hospital and in-hospital \\n\\nobservational studies, insufficient depth of compression (when compared with currently \\n\\nrecommended depths) was commonly observed during CPR. Three adult human studies \\n\\nshow that the measured compression depth during adult human resuscitation is often less \\n\\nthan 4 cm. No human studies directly compared the effectiveness of currently recommended \\n\\ncompression depth of more than 5 cm in adults with alternative compression depths.10 \\n\\nThe ideal depth of compression for human cardiac arrest management remains unknown. \\n\\nOne adult human case series two adult human studies with retrospective control groups and \\n\\none additional study suggest that compressions of 5 cm or more may improve the success of \\n\\ndefibrillation and ROSC. These findings are supported by three swine studies showing \\n\\nimproved survival with deeper compression depths, and one adult human study showing \\n\\nthat improved force on the chest produced a linear increase in systolic blood pressure. \\n\\nHowever, one swine study reported no improvement of myocardial blood flow with \\n\\nincreased compression depth from 4 cm to 5 cm although coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) \\n\\nimproved from 7 to 14 mm Hg.10 \\n\\nThere is a high degree of variability in the size and shape of adult chests. In one CT study of \\n\\n100 patients, compression depths of 4-5 cm equated to approximately 16-21% of the depth \\n\\n(AP diameter) of an adult chest.20   \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nWhen performing chest compressions it is reasonable to compress the sternum at least one \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 11 of 22 \\n\\nthird of the depth of the chest [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] or at least 5cm for all \\n\\nadult cardiac arrest patients [COSTR 2015 strong recommendation, low quality evidence].21  \\n\\nARC places greater importance on adequate compression depth. Although there is some \\n\\nevidence suggesting detriment with compression depths greater than 6cm, the clinical reality \\n\\nof being able to tell the difference between 5 or 6 cm and adjust compressions accordingly is \\n\\nquestionable. Inadequate compression depth is definitely associated with poor outcomes. \\n\\nARC has elected not to put an upper limit on compression depth as the risk of too shallow \\n\\ncompressions outweighs the risk of compressions that are too deep.

Some studies in \\n\\nanimal models of cardiac arrest showed that high-frequency CPR (120-150 compressions/min) \\n\\nimproved haemodynamics without increasing trauma when compared with 60 \\n\\ncompressions/min, whereas others showed no such benefit.  \\n\\nSome studies in animals showed more effect from other variables, such as duty cycle (see \\n\\nbelow). In humans, high-frequency CPR (120 compressions/min) improved haemodynamics \\n\\nover 60 compressions/min.22 However, in observational studies of mechanical CPR in humans \\n\\nhigh-frequency CPR (up to 140 compressions/min) showed no improvement in \\n\\nhaemodynamics when compared with 60 compressions/min.19  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nIt is reasonable for lay rescuers and healthcare providers to perform chest compressions at a \\n\\nrate of 100-120 compressions per minute [COSTR 2015 strong recommendation, very-low-\\n\\nquality evidence].21  \\n\\nARC acknowledges that compression rates will vary between and within providers. \\n\\nNevertheless, survival rates are optimised at compressions rates of 100-120 compressions per \\n\\nminute. There is some evidence that compressions rates less than 100 or greater than 140 \\n\\ncompressions per minute are associated with lower rates of survival.21,23,24  [COSTR 2015 \\n\\nValues and Preferences Statement] 21  \\n\\n',\n",

One out-of-hospital case series \\n\\ndocumented a 46% incidence of incomplete chest recoil by professional rescuers using the \\n\\nCPR technique recommended in 2000, and two in-hospital paediatric case series \\n\\ndemonstrated a 23% incidence of incomplete recoil that was more common just following \\n\\nswitching providers of chest compressions. Another study electronically recorded chest recoil \\n\\nduring in-hospital paediatric cardiac arrests and found that leaning on the chest occurred in \\n\\nhalf of chest compressions.  \\n\\nAnimal studies demonstrate significant reductions in mean arterial pressure, coronary \\n\\nperfusion pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial blood flow with only small amounts of \\n\\nincomplete chest recoil. Chest recoil can be increased significantly with simple techniques; for \\n\\nexample, lifting the heel of the hand slightly but completely off the chest during CPR \\n\\nimproved chest recoil in a manikin model. However, these alternative techniques may also \\n\\nreduce compression depth.10 \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nWhile allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression may improve circulation, \\n\\nthere is insufficient evidence to determine the optimal method to achieve the goal without \\n\\ncompromising other aspects of chest compression technique.10 \\n\\n8.7 Provision of a Firm Surface for CPR \\n\\nOne case series and four manikin studies demonstrated that chest compressions performed \\n\\non a bed are often too shallow.10 No studies have examined the risks or benefits of moving the \\n\\npatient from a bed to the floor to perform CPR.10 No studies in humans have evaluated the \\n\\nrisks or benefits of placing a backboard beneath a patient during CPR. Manikin studies \\n\\nsuggested that placing a backboard may improve compression depth by a few millimetres.10  \\n\\nOne manikin study showed that deflating a special mattress improved compression \\n\\nefficiency, but another manikin study failed to demonstrate any benefit from deflating an air-\\n\\nfilled mattress.10 \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nCPR should be performed on a firm surface when possible. Air filled mattresses should be \\n\\nroutinely deflated during CPR. There is insufficient evidence for or against the use of \\n\\nbackboards during CPR. If a backboard is used, rescuers should minimise delay in initiation \\n\\nof chest compressions, minimise interruption in chest compressions, and take care to avoid \\n\\ndislodging of catheters and tubes during backboard placement.10 [Class A; LOE Manikin \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 13 of 22 \\n\\nstudy] Rescuers who use devices that provide feedback on CPR quality should be aware of \\n\\nthe potential overestimation of compression depth when the patient is on a soft surface. \\n\\n8.8 Minimise Interruptions to CPR \\n\\nInterruptions in external cardiac compressions result in a fall in coronary perfusion pressure, \\n25 and an associated decrease in the likelihood of successful defibrillation.26, 27  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nRescuers should minimise interruptions of chest compressions during the entire resuscitation \\n\\nattempt.10 \\n\\nCPR should be continued without interruptions unless the patient responds, starts breathing \\n\\nnormally, or it is necessary to stop to perform specific tasks (e.g. tracheal intubation, rhythm \\n\\nanalysis or defibrillation).

A normal respiratory rate of 10-12 breaths per minute \\n\\nmay be detrimental in the presence of low cardiac output (including during cardiac arrest). In \\n\\nan animal study, 12 breaths per minute appeared excessive.28 Emphasis should be placed on \\n\\ntrying to oxygenate the aortic blood rather than removing carbon dioxide during low flow \\n\\nstates. Oxygen should be administered as soon as possible. \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nHealth care professionals should provide chest compressions with ventilations for cardiac \\n\\narrest patients. There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the provision of chest \\n\\ncompressions plus airway opening and oxygen insufflation by professional rescuers during \\n\\nthe first few minutes of resuscitation from cardiac arrest.10 In adult cardiac arrest patients, to \\n\\nmaximise the number of compressions given, minimise interruptions of chest compressions, \\n\\nand simplify instruction for teaching and skills retention, a single compression: ventilation \\n\\nratio of 30:2 is recommended before the airway is secured irrespective of the number of \\n\\nrescuers. [Class A; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion]  \\n\\nIn paediatric advanced life support rescue by healthcare rescuers (see ANZCOR Guideline \\n\\n12.2), the ratio should be 2 breaths then 15 compressions. Rescuers trained in paediatric \\n\\nadvanced life support may use the BLS approach (30:2) in circumstances where this is more \\n\\nachievable. Examples might include rescuers working with others trained in the 30:2 \\n\\napproach, being a solo rescuer, or adverse physical environments. \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 14 of 22 \\n\\nAfter an advanced airway (e.g. tracheal tube, supraglottic airway) is in place, ventilate the \\n\\npatient’s lungs with 100% oxygen to make the chest rise. During CPR for a patient with an \\n\\nadvanced airway in place, it is reasonable to ventilate the lungs at a rate of 6 to 10 ventilations \\n\\nper minute, without pausing during chest compressions to deliver ventilations. [CoSTR 2015, \\n\\nweak recommendation, very low quality evidence].3 Compressions need not be paused, but \\n\\nventilations will need to be timed to avoid simultaneous ventilation and compression. \\n\\nSimultaneous ventilation and compression may adversely affect coronary perfusion,22 and \\n\\nhas been associated with decreased survival.29 As previously recommended, one starting \\n\\npoint to provide consistent ventilation and an adequate minute volume while minimising \\n\\ninterruptions to CPR, and minimising the likelihood of excessive ventilation, is to provide one \\n\\nbreath after each 15 compressions (delivering the breath during the relaxation phase of \\n\\ncompression, without a significant pause).25 [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\nAdequacy of chest rise and fall must be assessed for each breath, but it is easier to ensure that \\n\\na single delivered breath is adequate once the airway has been secured.  \\n\\nFor mouth-to-mouth ventilation for adult patients using exhaled air or bag-mask ventilation \\n\\nwith room air or oxygen, it is reasonable to administer each breath within a 1 second \\n\\ninspiratory time to achieve chest rise. It is reasonable to use the same initial tidal volume and \\n\\nrate in patients regardless of the cause of the cardiac arrest.10 [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus \\n\\nOpinion].  \\n\\n8.10 Fatigue \\n\\nThe compression rate and depth is variable among rescuers and compressions may be worse \\n\\nin the first 5 minutes of the arrest.15 One manikin study of rescuer CPR showed that \\n\\ncompressions became shallow within one minute, but providers became aware of fatigue \\n\\nonly after 5 min.19  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nWhen feasible, rescuers should frequently alternate the role of chest compressions (e.g. every \\n\\n2 minutes), regardless of whether they feel fatigued, to ensure that fatigue does not interfere \\n\\nwith delivery of adequate chest compressions. [Class A; LOE Manikin study]  Rescuer fatigue \\n\\nmay be demonstrated by deterioration in chest compression quality, in particular, depth of \\n\\ncompressions.

Such monitoring will allow \\n\\nfeedback regarding technique and possible fatigue. \\n\\nA number of devices may also be available to monitor the adequacy of CPR.32 Eleven studies \\n\\nshowed that physiologic monitoring values (end tidal CO2, coronary perfusion pressure, \\n\\nvenous oxygen saturation) increased when return of spontaneous circulation was achieved \\n\\nand may be an indication of ROSC before it can be seen in vital signs.13 \\n\\n8.14 End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring to guide therapy during \\ncardiac arrest   \\n\\nNo studies have addressed this question directly.  In experimental models, the end-tidal \\n\\ncarbon dioxide concentration during ongoing CPR correlated with cardiac output, coronary \\n\\nperfusion pressure, and successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Thirteen studies \\n\\nindicated that higher maximal end-tidal CO2 levels can predict ROSC. Seven studies \\n\\ndemonstrate that end-tidal CO2 values <10 mmHg obtained after intubation and during CPR \\n\\nefforts are associated with a low probability of survival from cardiac arrest. However, two \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 16 of 22 \\n\\nstudies documented patients who did not meet the ETCO2 range but who survived. Multiple \\n\\nstudies by one group showed that when ETCO2 exceeded 10 mm Hg, all patients achieved \\n\\nROSC. In one of these studies all the survivors had an initial ETCO2 higher than 10mmHg. \\n\\nSimilarly, two studies showed that if the ETCO2 did not exceed 10 mmHg, survival was \\n\\nzero.13 Two prospective human studies demonstrated a significant increase in end-tidal CO2 \\n\\nwhen ROSC occurs.13 \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nQuantitative measurement of end tidal CO2 is a safe and effective non-invasive indicator of \\n\\ncardiac output during CPR and may be an early indicator of return of spontaneous circulation \\n\\nin intubated patients.  Continuous capnography or capnometry monitoring, if available, may \\n\\nbe beneficial by providing feedback on the effectiveness of chest compressions.13 \\n\\nARC suggests that an ETCO2 of 10 mm Hg or greater measured after tracheal intubation or \\n\\n',\n",

The same studies indicate that \\n\\nboth arterial and mixed venous blood gases are required to establish the magnitude of the \\n\\ntissue acidosis.   \\n\\nArterial blood gas analysis can disclose the degree of hypoxaemia and highlight the extent of \\n\\nmetabolic acidosis. Arterial CO2 is an indicator of adequacy of ventilation during CPR. If \\n\\nventilation is constant an increase in PaCO2  is a potential marker of improved perfusion \\n\\nduring CPR.13 \\n\\nImprovements in blood gases may be due to better ventilation or increased cardiac output \\n\\nand are thus only an approximate indicator of the adequacy of ventilation during CPR.  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nArterial blood gas monitoring may be considered during cardiac arrest as it enables \\n\\nestimation of the degree of hypoxaemia and the adequacy of ventilation during CPR but is \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 17 of 22 \\n\\nnot a reliable indicator of the extent of tissue acidosis. [Class A; LOE II-IV, Other]  \\n\\nLow levels of PaCO2 may indicate a need to reduce the respiratory rate. High levels of PaCO2 \\n\\nmay need to be tolerated during resuscitation attempts, as the potential benefits of increasing \\n\\nthe ventilation rate during CPR must be balanced against the potential detrimental effects \\n\\n(increased intra-thoracic pressure, and decreased coronary perfusion pressure). 16 Blood \\n\\nsampling also allows estimation of electrolyte concentrations (including potassium, calcium \\n\\nand magnesium). Blood sampling should not interrupt chest compressions. \\n\\n8.16 Coronary perfusion pressure to guide resuscitation  \\n\\nCoronary perfusion pressure (CPP; aortic relaxation [diastolic] pressure minus the right atrial \\n\\nrelaxation pressure) during CPR in humans correlated with both myocardial blood flow and \\n\\nROSC: a value ≥15mmHg is predictive of ROSC. Increased CPP correlates with improved 24-\\n\\nh survival in animal studies and is associated with improved myocardial blood flow and \\n\\nROSC in animal studies involving adrenaline, vasopressin, and angiotensin II.33  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nCoronary perfusion pressure can be used as a guide to therapy during cardiac arrest [Class B; \\n\\nLOE III-2].  \\n\\nIn an intensive care facility, the availability of direct arterial and central venous pressure \\n\\nmonitoring makes calculation of CPP potentially useful. Outside the intensive care facility the \\n\\ntechnical difficulties of invasive monitoring of arterial and central venous pressure make it \\n\\ndifficult to calculate CPP routinely during cardiac arrest.   \\n\\n8.17 Real-Time Feedback Devices \\n\\nEleven studies investigated the effect of giving real-time CPR performance feedback to \\n\\nrescuers during actual cardiac arrest events in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. \\n\\nTwo studies with concurrent controls in adults and one study with concurrent controls in \\n\\nchildren showed improved end-tidal CO2 measurements and consistent chest compression \\n\\nrates when feedback was provided from audio prompts (metronomes or sirens).10 \\n\\nIn four studies with retrospective controls, and two case series, real-time feedback from force \\n\\ntransducers and accelerometer devices was useful in improving CPR quality metrics, \\n\\nincluding compression depth, rate, and complete chest recoil.10  \\n\\nTwo manikin studies demonstrated the potential for overestimating compression depth when \\n\\nusing an accelerometer chest compression feedback device if compressions are performed \\n\\n(with or without a backboard) on a soft surface. No studies to date have demonstrated a \\n\\nsignificant improvement in long-term survival related to the use of CPR feedback/prompt \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'devices during actual cardiac arrest events.10 \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nReal-time chest compression-sensing and feedback/prompt technology (i.e. visual and \\n\\nauditory prompting devices) may be useful adjuncts during resuscitation efforts. However, \\n\\nrescuers should be aware of the potential overestimation of compression depth when the \\n\\npatient is on a soft surface.10 \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 18 of 22 \\n\\nCPR prompt /feedback devices may be considered for clinical use as part of an overall \\n\\nstrategy to improve the quality of CPR. Instructors and rescuers should be made aware that a \\n\\ncompressible support surface (e.g. mattress) may cause a feedback device to overestimate \\n\\ndepth of compression.2 \\n\\nThere is no high level evidence that the use of CPR feedback devices during real time CPR \\n\\nimproves survival or return of spontaneous circulation.21 [COSTR 2015 weak \\n\\nrecommendation, very low quality evidence] CPR prompt / feedback devices may be \\n\\nconsidered for clinical use to provide data as part of an overall strategy to improve quality of \\n\\nCPR at a systems level. 21, 2 [COSTR 2015 weak recommendation, very low quality evidence]  \\n\\nARC places a higher value on resource allocation and cost effectiveness than widespread \\n\\nimplementation of a technology with uncertain effectiveness during real time CPR. We \\n\\nacknowledge that data provided by CPR feedback devices may benefit other patients as part \\n\\nof a broader quality improvement system.21 [COSTR 2015 Values and Preferences Statement]  \\n\\n8.18 Audit, Feedback and Quality Improvement \\n\\nIn a number of case series, the CPR compression rate and depth provided by lay responders, \\n\\nphysician trainees and emergency services personnel were insufficient when compared with \\n\\nthe methods recommended at that time.19 Ventilation rates and durations higher or longer \\n\\nthan recommended when CPR is performed impaired haemodynamics and reduced survival \\n\\nrates in animals.16 It is likely that poor performance of CPR in humans also impairs \\n\\nhaemodynamics and possibly survival rates. Allocating personnel or equipment to \\n\\nspecifically monitor the rate and depth of compressions and ventilation may improve \\n\\nperformance. \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nIt is reasonable for instructors, trainees, providers, and emergency services to monitor and \\n\\nimprove the process of CPR to improve the CPR quality by ensuring adherence to \\n\\nrecommended compression and ventilation rates and depths. [Class B; LOE Expert \\n\\nConsensus Opinion]  It is reasonable to recommend the use of briefings and debriefings \\n\\nduring both learning and actual clinical activities.2 [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\nIt is reasonable to use cognitive aids (e.g. checklists) during resuscitation provided they do \\n\\nnot delay the start of resuscitation efforts. Aids should be validated using simulation or \\n\\npatient trials, both before and after implementation to guide rapid cycle improvement.2 [Class \\n\\nB; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\n8.19 Harm to Patients during CPR \\n\\nPost-mortem studies have identified a significant number of thoracic injuries after CPR.35 \\n\\nThere are no data to suggest that the performance of CPR by bystanders leads to more \\n\\ncomplications than CPR performed by professional rescuers. One study documented no \\n\\ndifference in the incidence of injuries on chest radiograph for arrest patients with and without \\n\\nbystander CPR. One study documented a higher rate of complications among inpatient arrest \\n\\npatients treated by less-experienced (non-ICU) rescuers. Two studies reported that serious \\n\\ncomplications among non-arrest patients receiving dispatch-assisted bystander CPR occurred \\n\\ninfrequently. Of 247 non-arrest patients with complete follow up who received chest \\n\\ncompressions from a bystander, 12% experienced discomfort; only 5 (2%) suffered a fracture; \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 19 of 22 \\n\\nand no patients suffered visceral organ injury.35 \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nIn individuals with presumed cardiac arrest, CPR rarely leads to serious harm in patients \\n\\nwho are eventually found not to be cardiac arrest; and therefore CPR should be assertively \\n\\nencouraged.10 [Class A; LOE III-2 to IV]  Rib fractures and other injuries are common but \\n\\nacceptable consequences of CPR given the alternative of death.10 [Class A; LOE IV, \\n\\nextrapolated evidence] CPR should be initiated for presumed cardiac arrest without concerns \\n\\nof harm to patients not in cardiac arrest.21 [COSTR 2015, strong recommendation, very-low-\\n\\nquality evidence].  \\n\\nIn making this recommendation, ARC places a higher value on the survival benefit of CPR \\n\\ninitiated by laypersons and others for patients in cardiac arrest against the low risk of injury \\n\\nin patients not in cardiac arrest. 21 \\n\\n8.20  Ventilation rates after return of spontaneous circulation  \\n\\nThe requirements for alveolar (minute) ventilation after return of spontaneous circulation \\n\\ndepend on the specific circumstances.

It should be read in conjunction \\n\\nwith BLS, ALS and Paediatric guidelines. \\n\\nWho does this guideline apply to? \\n\\nThis guideline applies to adults and children who require advanced life support (ALS) in an \\n\\nin-hospital environment. \\n\\nWho is the audience for this guideline? \\n\\nThis guideline is for health care professionals in hospital environments where equipment and \\n\\nmedications are available. \\n\\nRecommendations \\n\\nThe Australian Resuscitation Council (ARC) recommends that:  \\n\\n1.  As soon as possible, Advanced Life Support treatments are used to supplement the care of \\n\\nany patient receiving Basic Life Support.  \\n\\n2.  Hospitals use early warning, rapid response team, or medical emergency team systems to \\n\\nreduce the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrests, and in-hospital mortality, and to treat \\n\\npatient deterioration.  \\n\\n3.  Hospitals use a system validated for their specific patient population to identify \\n\\nindividuals at increased risk of serious clinical deterioration, cardiac arrest, or death, both \\n\\non admission to hospital and during their stay.  \\n\\n \\n\\nSystems should ensure: \\n\\n \\n\\n• clinical deterioration is recognised early to prevent cardiac arrest; \\n\\n• cardiorespiratory arrest is recognised immediately; \\n\\n• help is summoned using a specific telephone number/call system; \\n\\n• CPR is started immediately and, if indicated, defibrillation is attempted as soon as \\n\\npossible (ideally within 3 min). \\n\\n \\n\\n TN AUSTRALIAN RESUSCITATION COUNCIL \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 2 of 22 \\n\\nGuideline \\n\\n  Guideline Process \\n\\nThis guideline updates Guideline 11.1, incorporates the previous Guideline 11.1.1 \\n\\nCardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Advanced Life Support Providers, and includes new \\n\\nmaterial related to in-hospital resuscitation partly based on the Resuscitation Council (UK) \\n\\nIn-hospital resuscitation document.1 This guideline includes evidence from the 2015 ILCOR \\n\\nreview process using GRADE methodology and the NHMRC methodology used in the \\n\\nprevious Guideline 11.1.1. The guideline process includes involvement of stakeholders from \\n\\nall member organisations of the ARC, and peer review by the Australian Resuscitation \\n\\nCouncil and their Executive Committee. Details of the guidelines development process can be \\n\\nfound on the ARC website https://resus.org.au  \\n\\n Summary of changes \\n\\nCombines previous Guidelines 11.1 and 11.1.1 with the addition of further information on \\n\\nprinciples of in-hospital resuscitation. \\n\\n Introduction \\n\\nThis guideline is aimed primarily at health care professionals who are likely to be the first to \\n\\nrespond to an in-hospital cardiac arrest or significant clinical deterioration.  It may also be \\n\\napplicable to healthcare professionals working in other clinical settings. The ARC document \\n\\nStandards for Resuscitation: Clinical Practice and Education supports the implementation of \\n\\nthis guideline. https://resus.org.au/standards-for-resuscitation-clinical-practice-and-education  \\n\\nExcept where specified, the advice is the same for infants (other than newborns) and children \\n\\nas it is for adults.  \\n\\n Prevention of Cardiac Arrest      \\n\\nChildren and young adults presenting with characteristic symptoms of arrhythmic syncope \\n\\nshould have a specialist cardiology assessment, which should include an ECG and in most \\n\\ncases an echocardiogram and exercise test.2 [Class A, Expert consensus opinion]  \\n\\n \\n\\nCharacteristics of arrhythmic syncope include: syncope in the supine position, occurring \\n\\nduring or after exercise, with no or only brief prodromal symptoms, repetitive episodes, or in \\n\\nindividuals with a family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD). In addition, non-pleuritic \\n\\nchest pain, palpitations associated with syncope, seizures (when resistant to treatment, or \\n\\noccurring at night) should raise suspicion of increased risk of arrhythmic syncope. Systematic \\n\\nevaluation in a clinic specialising in the care of those at risk for SCD is recommended in \\n\\nfamily members of young victims of SCD or those with a known cardiac disorder resulting in \\n\\nan increased risk of SCD.2 [Class B; Expert consensus opinion] \\n\\n In-Hospital Pre-Arrest Detection and Management  \\n\\nIn adult patients admitted to hospital, there is variable evidence regarding the use of early \\n\\nwarning systems/rapid response team (RRT) systems or medical emergency team (MET) \\n\\nhttps://resus.org.au/\\nhttps://resus.org.au/standards-for-resuscitation-clinical-practice-and-education\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 3 of 22 \\n\\nsystems (compared with no such systems) to reduce cardiac and respiratory arrests and \\n\\nhospital mortality.2  \\n\\n \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'ARC suggests that hospitals consider the introduction of an early warning score \\n\\nEWS/response team/MET system to reduce the incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCA) \\n\\nand in-hospital mortality (CoSTR 2015 weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).3 It is \\n\\nreasonable, and increasingly mandated by health authorities, that hospitals provide a system \\n\\nof care that includes2,4 : \\n\\n  \\n\\n•  staff education about the signs of patient deterioration;  \\n\\n•  appropriate and regular vital signs monitoring of patients;  \\n\\n•  clear guidance (e.g. via calling criteria or early warning scores) to assist staff in the early \\n\\ndetection   of patient deterioration;  \\n\\n•  a clear, uniform system of calling for assistance, and;  \\n\\n•  a clinical response to calls for assistance.  \\n\\n[Class A; Expert consensus opinion] \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to identify the best methods for the delivery of these \\n\\ncomponents, and on current evidence, this should be based on local circumstances.2, 4 [Class \\n\\nA; Expert consensus opinion]  Hospitals should use a system validated for their specific \\n\\npatient population to identify individuals at increased risk of serious clinical deterioration, \\n\\ncardiac arrest, or death, both on admission and during hospital stay.2 [Class A; Expert \\n\\nconsensus opinion].  \\n\\n \\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to identify specific educational strategies that improve \\n\\noutcomes (e.g. early recognition and rescue of deteriorating patient at risk of \\n\\ncardiac/respiratory arrest). Educational efforts have a positive impact on knowledge, skills, \\n\\nattitudes and confidence, and increase the frequency of activation of a response and should \\n\\ntherefore be considered.2 [Class A; Expert consensus opinion]. \\n\\n The importance of BLS \\n\\nBLS is only a temporary measure to maintain ventilation and circulation. Effective chest \\n\\ncompression provides a cardiac output of only 20-30% of the pre-arrest value 5, and rescue \\n\\nbreathing without supplemental oxygen provides ventilation with an inspired oxygen \\n\\nconcentration of only 15%.2,6 Electrical defibrillation is the mainstay of treatment for \\n\\nventricular fibrillation and pulseless VT. The chance of successful defibrillation decreases \\n\\nwith time. Therefore high quality CPR and decreasing the time to defibrillation are the first \\n\\npriorities in resuscitation from cardiac arrest. The purpose of BLS is to help maintain \\n\\nmyocardial and cerebral oxygenation until ALS personnel and equipment are available:  \\n\\n•  effective BLS may increase the likelihood of successful defibrillation.7  \\n\\n•  effective BLS buys time until reversible causes can be diagnosed and/or treated.  \\n\\n \\n\\nMonitoring CPR quality and resuscitation performance is an important element of Basic and \\n\\nAdvanced Life Support and includes:  \\n\\n \\n\\n•  effectiveness of compressions (adequacy of depth, rate and minimising hands off periods);  \\n\\n•  adequacy of ventilation (avoiding over-ventilation and consequent deleterious effects);  \\n\\n•  timing of defibrillation with regard to likelihood of success (as soon as possible and \\n\\nproviding compressions before and after).  \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 4 of 22 \\n\\nPatient care during the pre-arrest period (early detection and prevention of cardiac arrest) \\n\\nand the post-resuscitation management are also vital to improving patient outcomes.  \\n\\nAn extensive review of many aspects of advanced life support was performed as part of the \\n\\n2010 and 2015 Consensus on Science process.8-14 The information from this process has been \\n\\nincorporated into the guidelines wherever appropriate. \\n\\nAfter in-hospital cardiac arrest the division between Basic Life Support (BLS) and Advanced \\n\\nLife Support (ALS) is arbitrary; in practice, the resuscitation process is a continuum but BLS \\n\\nand ALS are specifically defined in the ARC Glossary. For all in-hospital cardiac arrests, \\n\\nensure: \\n\\n•  cardiorespiratory arrest is recognised immediately; \\n\\n•  help is summoned using a specific telephone number/call system; \\n\\n•  CPR is started immediately and, if indicated, defibrillation is attempted as soon as \\n\\npossible (ideally within 3 min). \\n\\nAll in-hospital cardiac arrests should be reviewed as part of an audit and quality \\n\\nimprovement process.

       "                '7.1 Personal safety and protective equipment \\n\\nThe personal safety of all individuals involved in resuscitation is paramount. While there are \\n\\nvery few reports of harm to rescuers during resuscitation the following principles should \\n\\napply: \\n\\n• always check that the environment and patient surroundings are safe before proceeding. \\n\\n• put on personal protective equipment (PPE) as soon as possible and as appropriate to the \\n\\npatient’s clinical status. Local infection control policies should be followed.  \\n\\n• all sharps should be handled with care and disposed of in a sharps container which \\n\\nshould be immediately available. Staff are responsible for the safe disposal of sharps they \\n\\nhave used. \\n\\n• safe manual handling techniques according to local policies should be used when moving \\n\\npatients during resuscitation, to protect both patients and staff.  \\n\\n• staff are clear of patient while shocks are delivered or the defibrillator is disarmed, prior to \\n\\nrecommencement of chest compressions. \\n\\n7.2 Checking the patient for a response \\n\\nFollowing a witnessed collapse or finding a collapsed patient, assess for response (ANZCOR \\n\\nGuideline 3).  If other members of staff are nearby it will be possible to undertake several \\n\\nactions simultaneously. \\n\\n7.3   If the patient responds \\n\\nThe patient will still require urgent medical assessment, so send for help according to local \\n\\nprotocols. This usually involves calling a Rapid Response Team (e.g. Medical Emergency \\n\\nTeam (MET)).  \\n\\nRapidly assess the patient using the Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure \\n\\n(ABCDE) approach including check blood glucose level, applying monitors (pulse oximeter, \\n\\nECG, blood pressure), giving oxygen if indicated and obtaining IV or intraosseous (IO) \\n\\naccess. Use the pulse oximeter to guide oxygen therapy (see Guideline 11.6.1 Targeted oxygen \\n\\ntherapy in adult advanced life support). Record vital signs and other assessments, addressing \\n\\nabnormalities according to the abilities of those responding, and prepare to handover to the \\n\\nRapid Response Team using the ISBAR (Identify, Situation, Background, Assessment, \\n\\nRecommendation) framework. \\n\\n7.4   If the patient does not respond \\n\\nSend for help as assistance will be needed immediately, and assess response, airway and \\n\\nbreathing according to ANZCOR BLS Flowchart (ANZCOR Guideline 8) then follow the \\n\\nANZCOR Advanced Life Support Guideline 11.2.  \\n\\nTurn the patient onto their back and open the airway using head tilt, chin lift or jaw thrust \\n\\nmanoeuvres. If there is a risk of cervical spine injury, jaw thrust or chin lift is preferred to \\n\\nhead tilt but a patent airway, oxygenation and ventilation takes priority over concerns about \\n\\npotential cervical spine injury. \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 6 of 22 \\n\\nKeeping the airway open, look, listen, and feel to determine if the patient is breathing \\n\\nnormally. This should take less than 10 seconds and involves: \\n\\nLooking for chest movement (breathing or coughing) \\n\\nListening at the patient’s mouth for breath sounds \\n\\nFeeling air movement on your hand/cheek \\n\\nLooking for other movement or signs of life \\n\\nIf the adult patient is not responsive and not breathing normally, commence chest \\n\\ncompressions (see ANZCOR Guideline 6). For children, CPR by advanced life support \\n\\nproviders should commence with 2 ventilations before starting chest compressions (see \\n\\nANZCOR Guideline 12.2). If trained and experienced in assessment of circulation in \\n\\ncollapsed patients: check for breathing and a central pulse at the same time. If there is any \\n\\nquestion over the presence or absence of a pulse it must be treated as if it were absent. Delays \\n\\nin diagnosing cardiac arrest and starting CPR will adversely affect chances of survival and \\n\\nmust be avoided, so if there is any doubt, commence CPR. Chest compressions in a patient \\n\\nwho is collapsed, unresponsive and not breathing normally, and whose heart is still beating \\n\\nare unlikely to cause harm. \\n\\nAgonal breaths (occasional, irregular gasps) are common in the early stages of cardiac arrest \\n\\nand are a sign of cardiac arrest. Agonal breathing and limb movement can also occur during \\n\\neffective chest compressions as cerebral perfusion improves, but are not indicative of a return \\n\\nof spontaneous circulation (ROSC). \\n\\nChanges in skin colour (e.g. pallor, cyanosis) in isolation are not diagnostic of cardiac arrest. \\n\\nGet resuscitation equipment and attach a defibrillator. If you are alone, you will need to leave \\n\\nthe patient temporarily to get equipment. If the patient is already attached to monitoring in a \\n\\ncritical care area this will facilitate rapid assessment but does not negate the need for clinical \\n\\nassessment. \\n\\nCommence 30 chest compressions followed by 2 ventilations, and continue with a ratio of \\n\\n30:2. For children, after initial 2 ventilations, continue with 15 chest compressions followed by \\n\\n2 ventilations (a ratio of 15:2).  \\n\\n',\n",

Compared with BLS providers, ALS providers \\n\\nare more likely to have performed and practised CPR. Despite this, observational studies of \\n\\nthe actual performance of CPR by heath care professionals have revealed inadequate depth of \\n\\ncompressions,15 excessive ventilation rates,16 and excessive interruptions to external cardiac \\n\\ncompressions.17 The general principles of cardiopulmonary resuscitation remain the same for \\n\\nALS providers as for BLS providers: provide good quality compressions, minimise \\n\\ninterruptions to compressions, fill the lungs with oxygen, and provide ventilation but avoid \\n\\nexcessive ventilation.  \\n\\nHealth care professionals should be trained to provide CPR with 30 chest compressions and 2 \\n\\nventilations for adult patients (15:2 in children) in cardiac arrest. Performing chest \\n\\ncompressions alone is reasonable for trained individuals if they are unable to deliver \\n\\nventilations to cardiac arrest patients.2 \\n\\nThe risk of disease transmission is very low and initiating rescue breathing without a barrier \\n\\ndevice is reasonable.

There is insufficient evidence \\n\\nto support or refute any recommendation on minimizing the incidence of psychological harm \\n\\nto rescuers.2 \\n\\n8.1 When to Commence CPR \\n\\nThe sequence of events for BLS is the same for ALS providers (see ANZCOR Guideline 8). If \\n\\nthe adult patient is not responsive, the airway should be cleared and breathing assessed, and \\n\\nif the patient is not breathing normally, then CPR should be commenced with 30 chest \\n\\ncompressions followed by 2 ventilations. In children, the same assessment sequence should \\n\\nbe followed but advanced life support providers deliver ventilation prior to chest \\n\\ncompressions. \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nIt is reasonable that lay rescuers and health care professionals commence CPR in patients \\n\\nwho are unresponsive and not breathing normally.10 A pulse check (even in the hands of \\n\\nhealthcare professionals) has limitations18 but if an ALS provider is trained in that technique \\n\\nthey can also check for a central pulse (e.g. carotid) for up to 10 seconds during the period of \\n\\nassessment for signs of life [Class A; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion]. \\n\\nPalpation of the pulse as the sole indicator of the presence or absence of cardiac arrest is \\n\\nunreliable.

Two techniques were previously taught \\n\\nto find the correct compression point (e.g. calliper method and alternative method) however \\n\\nthere were shorter pauses between ventilations and compressions if the hands were simply \\n\\npositioned ‘in the centre of the chest’.19  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nFor chest compressions, it is recommended that rescuers place their hands on the lower half \\n\\nof the sternum.

These findings are supported by three swine studies showing \\n\\nimproved survival with deeper compression depths, and one adult human study showing \\n\\nthat improved force on the chest produced a linear increase in systolic blood pressure. \\n\\nHowever, one swine study reported no improvement of myocardial blood flow with \\n\\nincreased compression depth from 4 cm to 5 cm although coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) \\n\\nimproved from 7 to 14 mm Hg.10 \\n\\nThere is a high degree of variability in the size and shape of adult chests.

Some studies in \\n\\nanimal models of cardiac arrest showed that high-frequency CPR (120-150 compressions/min) \\n\\nimproved haemodynamics without increasing trauma when compared with 60 \\n\\ncompressions/min, whereas others showed no such benefit.  \\n\\nSome studies in animals showed more effect from other variables, such as duty cycle (see \\n\\nbelow).

Another study electronically recorded chest recoil \\n\\nduring in-hospital paediatric cardiac arrests and found that leaning on the chest occurred in \\n\\nhalf of chest compressions.  \\n\\nAnimal studies demonstrate significant reductions in mean arterial pressure, coronary \\n\\nperfusion pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial blood flow with only small amounts of \\n\\nincomplete chest recoil. Chest recoil can be increased significantly with simple techniques; for \\n\\nexample, lifting the heel of the hand slightly but completely off the chest during CPR \\n\\nimproved chest recoil in a manikin model. However, these alternative techniques may also \\n\\nreduce compression depth.10 \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nWhile allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression may improve circulation, \\n\\nthere is insufficient evidence to determine the optimal method to achieve the goal without \\n\\ncompromising other aspects of chest compression technique.10 \\n\\n8.7 Provision of a Firm Surface for CPR \\n\\nOne case series and four manikin studies demonstrated that chest compressions performed \\n\\non a bed are often too shallow.10 No studies have examined the risks or benefits of moving the \\n\\npatient from a bed to the floor to perform CPR.10 No studies in humans have evaluated the \\n\\nrisks or benefits of placing a backboard beneath a patient during CPR. Manikin studies \\n\\nsuggested that placing a backboard may improve compression depth by a few millimetres.10  \\n\\nOne manikin study showed that deflating a special mattress improved compression \\n\\nefficiency, but another manikin study failed to demonstrate any benefit from deflating an air-\\n\\nfilled mattress.10 \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nCPR should be performed on a firm surface when possible. Air filled mattresses should be \\n\\nroutinely deflated during CPR. There is insufficient evidence for or against the use of \\n\\nbackboards during CPR. If a backboard is used, rescuers should minimise delay in initiation \\n\\nof chest compressions, minimise interruption in chest compressions, and take care to avoid \\n\\ndislodging of catheters and tubes during backboard placement.10 [Class A; LOE Manikin \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 13 of 22 \\n\\nstudy] Rescuers who use devices that provide feedback on CPR quality should be aware of \\n\\nthe potential overestimation of compression depth when the patient is on a soft surface. \\n\\n8.8 Minimise Interruptions to CPR \\n\\nInterruptions in external cardiac compressions result in a fall in coronary perfusion pressure, \\n25 and an associated decrease in the likelihood of successful defibrillation.26, 27  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nRescuers should minimise interruptions of chest compressions during the entire resuscitation \\n\\nattempt.10 \\n\\nCPR should be continued without interruptions unless the patient responds, starts breathing \\n\\nnormally, or it is necessary to stop to perform specific tasks (e.g. tracheal intubation, rhythm \\n\\nanalysis or defibrillation).

A normal respiratory rate of 10-12 breaths per minute \\n\\nmay be detrimental in the presence of low cardiac output (including during cardiac arrest). In \\n\\nan animal study, 12 breaths per minute appeared excessive.28 Emphasis should be placed on \\n\\ntrying to oxygenate the aortic blood rather than removing carbon dioxide during low flow \\n\\nstates. Oxygen should be administered as soon as possible. \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nHealth care professionals should provide chest compressions with ventilations for cardiac \\n\\narrest patients.

[CoSTR 2015, \\n\\nweak recommendation, very low quality evidence].3 Compressions need not be paused, but \\n\\nventilations will need to be timed to avoid simultaneous ventilation and compression. \\n\\nSimultaneous ventilation and compression may adversely affect coronary perfusion,22 and \\n\\nhas been associated with decreased survival.29 As previously recommended, one starting \\n\\npoint to provide consistent ventilation and an adequate minute volume while minimising \\n\\ninterruptions to CPR, and minimising the likelihood of excessive ventilation, is to provide one \\n\\nbreath after each 15 compressions (delivering the breath during the relaxation phase of \\n\\ncompression, without a significant pause).25 [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\nAdequacy of chest rise and fall must be assessed for each breath, but it is easier to ensure that \\n\\na single delivered breath is adequate once the airway has been secured.  \\n\\nFor mouth-to-mouth ventilation for adult patients using exhaled air or bag-mask ventilation \\n\\nwith room air or oxygen, it is reasonable to administer each breath within a 1 second \\n\\ninspiratory time to achieve chest rise. It is reasonable to use the same initial tidal volume and \\n\\nrate in patients regardless of the cause of the cardiac arrest.10 [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus \\n\\nOpinion].  \\n\\n8.10 Fatigue \\n\\nThe compression rate and depth is variable among rescuers and compressions may be worse \\n\\nin the first 5 minutes of the arrest.15 One manikin study of rescuer CPR showed that \\n\\ncompressions became shallow within one minute, but providers became aware of fatigue \\n\\nonly after 5 min.19  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nWhen feasible, rescuers should frequently alternate the role of chest compressions (e.g. every \\n\\n2 minutes), regardless of whether they feel fatigued, to ensure that fatigue does not interfere \\n\\nwith delivery of adequate chest compressions. [Class A; LOE Manikin study]  Rescuer fatigue \\n\\nmay be demonstrated by deterioration in chest compression quality, in particular, depth of \\n\\ncompressions. The change of rescuers performing chest compressions should be done with \\n\\nminimum interruption to the compressions.10 \\n\\n8.11 Performing CPR While Preparing to Administer a Shock \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'When using a defibrillator in manual mode, it is safe to charge the defibrillator while chest \\n\\ncompressions continue in preparation for rhythm analysis and possible defibrillation.30 This \\n\\napproach is not applicable when using a defibrillator in AED mode.  \\n\\nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend that continuing manual chest compressions \\n\\nduring shock delivery for defibrillation is safe.  \\n\\n8.12 Recommence CPR Immediately After a Shock \\n\\nThe recommendation to immediately start/recommence CPR after a shock is based on the \\n\\nobservation that in the first minute or so after defibrillation the chance of developing a \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 15 of 22 \\n\\nrhythm associated with an output is extremely small.27, 31 Starting CPR immediately after \\n\\ndefibrillation, irrespective of the electrical success (or otherwise) of the attempt at \\n\\ndefibrillation, restores blood flow to the brain and heart and creates a milieu more conducive \\n\\nto return of spontaneous circulation. A period of high quality CPR (e.g. for 1-3 minutes) \\n\\nappears to be able to increase the likelihood of success of the next attempt at defibrillation.7, 26  \\n\\nFive animal studies and one human study confirmed that more interruption of chest \\n\\ncompressions during CPR reduced ROSC and survival.10 In two case series, a palpable pulse \\n\\nwas rarely present immediately after defibrillation, suggesting that a pulse check after a \\n\\nshock is not useful and delays the resumption of chest compressions.10  \\n\\nIn two adult out-of-hospital witnessed VF studies with historical controls and three animal \\n\\nstudies immediate resumption of chest compressions after defibrillation was associated with \\n\\nbetter survival rates and/or survival with favourable neurological outcome compared with \\n\\nimmediate rhythm analysis and delayed resumption of chest compression.10 However, in one \\n\\nrandomised study, immediate resumption of chest compressions after defibrillation was \\n\\nassociated with earlier VF recurrence when compared to a pulse check prior to resumption of \\n\\nCPR; there was no difference in cumulative incidence of VF 60 s after the shock.10 \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nCPR should be recommenced immediately after attempting defibrillation, irrespective of the \\n\\napparent electrical success (or otherwise) of the attempt [Class A; LOE Expert Consensus \\n\\nOpinion].  \\n\\nAfter about 2 minutes of CPR, or earlier if responsiveness or normal breathing become \\n\\napparent, the rhythm should be checked. If a rhythm compatible with spontaneous \\n\\ncirculation is observed then the pulse should also be checked [Class A; LOE Expert \\n\\nConsensus Opinion].  \\n\\n8.13 Monitoring Adequacy of CPR \\n\\nThe simplest and most important component of monitoring is the clinical assessment of the \\n\\nadequacy of CPR: observation of the appropriateness of the technique of compressions \\n\\n(positioning, rate and depth) and ventilation (rate, and depth). Such monitoring will allow \\n\\nfeedback regarding technique and possible fatigue. \\n\\nA number of devices may also be available to monitor the adequacy of CPR.32 Eleven studies \\n\\nshowed that physiologic monitoring values (end tidal CO2, coronary perfusion pressure, \\n\\nvenous oxygen saturation) increased when return of spontaneous circulation was achieved \\n\\nand may be an indication of ROSC before it can be seen in vital signs.13 \\n\\n8.14 End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring to guide therapy during \\ncardiac arrest   \\n\\nNo studies have addressed this question directly.  In experimental models, the end-tidal \\n\\ncarbon dioxide concentration during ongoing CPR correlated with cardiac output, coronary \\n\\nperfusion pressure, and successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Thirteen studies \\n\\nindicated that higher maximal end-tidal CO2 levels can predict ROSC. Seven studies \\n\\ndemonstrate that end-tidal CO2 values <10 mmHg obtained after intubation and during CPR \\n\\nefforts are associated with a low probability of survival from cardiac arrest. However, two \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 16 of 22 \\n\\nstudies documented patients who did not meet the ETCO2 range but who survived. Multiple \\n\\nstudies by one group showed that when ETCO2 exceeded 10 mm Hg, all patients achieved \\n\\nROSC. In one of these studies all the survivors had an initial ETCO2 higher than 10mmHg. \\n\\nSimilarly, two studies showed that if the ETCO2 did not exceed 10 mmHg, survival was \\n\\nzero.13 Two prospective human studies demonstrated a significant increase in end-tidal CO2 \\n\\nwhen ROSC occurs.13 \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nQuantitative measurement of end tidal CO2 is a safe and effective non-invasive indicator of \\n\\ncardiac output during CPR and may be an early indicator of return of spontaneous circulation \\n\\nin intubated patients.  Continuous capnography or capnometry monitoring, if available, may \\n\\nbe beneficial by providing feedback on the effectiveness of chest compressions.13 \\n\\nARC suggests that an ETCO2 of 10 mm Hg or greater measured after tracheal intubation or \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'after 20 minutes of resuscitation, may be a predictor of ROSC (CoSTR 2015, weak \\n\\nrecommendation, low-quality evidence).3  \\n\\nARC suggests that an ETCO2 of 10 mm Hg or greater measured after tracheal intubation, or \\n\\nan ETCO2   of 20 mm Hg or greater measured after 20 min of resuscitation may be a predictor \\n\\nof survival to discharge (CoSTR 2015, weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).3 \\n\\nAlthough low values of end tidal CO2 are associated with a low probability of survival, there \\n\\nare insufficient data to support or refute a specific cut off of end tidal CO2 at different time \\n\\nintervals as a prognostic indicator of outcome during adult cardiac arrest. ARC recommends \\n\\nagainst using ETCO2 cut-off values alone as a mortality predictor, or for the decision to stop a \\n\\nresuscitation attempt (CoSTR 2015, strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).3 \\n\\nDuring a cardiac arrest, the ETCO2 value should not be used as a guide for ventilation, and \\n\\nrescuers should be wary about using it to guide ventilation in the immediate post \\n\\nresuscitation phase. \\n\\n8.15 Arterial blood gas monitoring during cardiac arrest  \\n\\nThere was evidence from one case series and 11 other related studies that arterial blood gas \\n\\nvalues are not accurate indicators of the magnitude of tissue acidosis during cardiac arrest \\n\\nand CPR in both the in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. The same studies indicate that \\n\\nboth arterial and mixed venous blood gases are required to establish the magnitude of the \\n\\ntissue acidosis.   \\n\\nArterial blood gas analysis can disclose the degree of hypoxaemia and highlight the extent of \\n\\nmetabolic acidosis. Arterial CO2 is an indicator of adequacy of ventilation during CPR. If \\n\\nventilation is constant an increase in PaCO2  is a potential marker of improved perfusion \\n\\nduring CPR.13 \\n\\nImprovements in blood gases may be due to better ventilation or increased cardiac output \\n\\nand are thus only an approximate indicator of the adequacy of ventilation during CPR.  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nArterial blood gas monitoring may be considered during cardiac arrest as it enables \\n\\nestimation of the degree of hypoxaemia and the adequacy of ventilation during CPR but is \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 17 of 22 \\n\\nnot a reliable indicator of the extent of tissue acidosis. [Class A; LOE II-IV, Other]  \\n\\nLow levels of PaCO2 may indicate a need to reduce the respiratory rate. High levels of PaCO2 \\n\\nmay need to be tolerated during resuscitation attempts, as the potential benefits of increasing \\n\\nthe ventilation rate during CPR must be balanced against the potential detrimental effects \\n\\n(increased intra-thoracic pressure, and decreased coronary perfusion pressure). 16 Blood \\n\\nsampling also allows estimation of electrolyte concentrations (including potassium, calcium \\n\\nand magnesium). Blood sampling should not interrupt chest compressions. \\n\\n8.16 Coronary perfusion pressure to guide resuscitation  \\n\\nCoronary perfusion pressure (CPP; aortic relaxation [diastolic] pressure minus the right atrial \\n\\nrelaxation pressure) during CPR in humans correlated with both myocardial blood flow and \\n\\nROSC: a value ≥15mmHg is predictive of ROSC. Increased CPP correlates with improved 24-\\n\\nh survival in animal studies and is associated with improved myocardial blood flow and \\n\\nROSC in animal studies involving adrenaline, vasopressin, and angiotensin II.33  \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nCoronary perfusion pressure can be used as a guide to therapy during cardiac arrest [Class B; \\n\\nLOE III-2].  \\n\\nIn an intensive care facility, the availability of direct arterial and central venous pressure \\n\\nmonitoring makes calculation of CPP potentially useful. Outside the intensive care facility the \\n\\ntechnical difficulties of invasive monitoring of arterial and central venous pressure make it \\n\\ndifficult to calculate CPP routinely during cardiac arrest.   \\n\\n8.17 Real-Time Feedback Devices \\n\\nEleven studies investigated the effect of giving real-time CPR performance feedback to \\n\\nrescuers during actual cardiac arrest events in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. \\n\\nTwo studies with concurrent controls in adults and one study with concurrent controls in \\n\\nchildren showed improved end-tidal CO2 measurements and consistent chest compression \\n\\nrates when feedback was provided from audio prompts (metronomes or sirens).10 \\n\\nIn four studies with retrospective controls, and two case series, real-time feedback from force \\n\\ntransducers and accelerometer devices was useful in improving CPR quality metrics, \\n\\nincluding compression depth, rate, and complete chest recoil.10  \\n\\nTwo manikin studies demonstrated the potential for overestimating compression depth when \\n\\nusing an accelerometer chest compression feedback device if compressions are performed \\n\\n(with or without a backboard) on a soft surface. No studies to date have demonstrated a \\n\\nsignificant improvement in long-term survival related to the use of CPR feedback/prompt \\n\\n',\n",
       "                'devices during actual cardiac arrest events.10 \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nReal-time chest compression-sensing and feedback/prompt technology (i.e. visual and \\n\\nauditory prompting devices) may be useful adjuncts during resuscitation efforts. However, \\n\\nrescuers should be aware of the potential overestimation of compression depth when the \\n\\npatient is on a soft surface.10 \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 18 of 22 \\n\\nCPR prompt /feedback devices may be considered for clinical use as part of an overall \\n\\nstrategy to improve the quality of CPR. Instructors and rescuers should be made aware that a \\n\\ncompressible support surface (e.g. mattress) may cause a feedback device to overestimate \\n\\ndepth of compression.2 \\n\\nThere is no high level evidence that the use of CPR feedback devices during real time CPR \\n\\nimproves survival or return of spontaneous circulation.21 [COSTR 2015 weak \\n\\nrecommendation, very low quality evidence] CPR prompt / feedback devices may be \\n\\nconsidered for clinical use to provide data as part of an overall strategy to improve quality of \\n\\nCPR at a systems level. 21, 2 [COSTR 2015 weak recommendation, very low quality evidence]  \\n\\nARC places a higher value on resource allocation and cost effectiveness than widespread \\n\\nimplementation of a technology with uncertain effectiveness during real time CPR. We \\n\\nacknowledge that data provided by CPR feedback devices may benefit other patients as part \\n\\nof a broader quality improvement system.21 [COSTR 2015 Values and Preferences Statement]  \\n\\n8.18 Audit, Feedback and Quality Improvement \\n\\nIn a number of case series, the CPR compression rate and depth provided by lay responders, \\n\\nphysician trainees and emergency services personnel were insufficient when compared with \\n\\nthe methods recommended at that time.19 Ventilation rates and durations higher or longer \\n\\nthan recommended when CPR is performed impaired haemodynamics and reduced survival \\n\\nrates in animals.16 It is likely that poor performance of CPR in humans also impairs \\n\\nhaemodynamics and possibly survival rates. Allocating personnel or equipment to \\n\\nspecifically monitor the rate and depth of compressions and ventilation may improve \\n\\nperformance. \\n\\nRecommendation  \\n\\nIt is reasonable for instructors, trainees, providers, and emergency services to monitor and \\n\\nimprove the process of CPR to improve the CPR quality by ensuring adherence to \\n\\nrecommended compression and ventilation rates and depths. [Class B; LOE Expert \\n\\nConsensus Opinion]  It is reasonable to recommend the use of briefings and debriefings \\n\\nduring both learning and actual clinical activities.2 [Class B; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\nIt is reasonable to use cognitive aids (e.g. checklists) during resuscitation provided they do \\n\\nnot delay the start of resuscitation efforts. Aids should be validated using simulation or \\n\\npatient trials, both before and after implementation to guide rapid cycle improvement.2 [Class \\n\\nB; LOE Expert Consensus Opinion] \\n\\n8.19 Harm to Patients during CPR \\n\\nPost-mortem studies have identified a significant number of thoracic injuries after CPR.35 \\n\\nThere are no data to suggest that the performance of CPR by bystanders leads to more \\n\\ncomplications than CPR performed by professional rescuers. One study documented no \\n\\ndifference in the incidence of injuries on chest radiograph for arrest patients with and without \\n\\nbystander CPR. One study documented a higher rate of complications among inpatient arrest \\n\\npatients treated by less-experienced (non-ICU) rescuers. Two studies reported that serious \\n\\ncomplications among non-arrest patients receiving dispatch-assisted bystander CPR occurred \\n\\ninfrequently. Of 247 non-arrest patients with complete follow up who received chest \\n\\ncompressions from a bystander, 12% experienced discomfort; only 5 (2%) suffered a fracture; \\n\\n\\n\\nARC Guideline 11.1  February 2019 Page 19 of 22 \\n\\nand no patients suffered visceral organ injury.35 \\n\\nRecommendation \\n\\nIn individuals with presumed cardiac arrest, CPR rarely leads to serious harm in patients \\n\\nwho are eventually found not to be cardiac arrest; and therefore CPR should be assertively \\n\\nencouraged.10 [Class A; LOE III-2 to IV]  Rib fractures and other injuries are common but \\n\\nacceptable consequences of CPR given the alternative of death.10 [Class A; LOE IV, \\n\\nextrapolated evidence] CPR should be initiated for presumed cardiac arrest without concerns \\n\\nof harm to patients not in cardiac arrest.21 [COSTR 2015, strong recommendation, very-low-\\n\\nquality evidence].  \\n\\nIn making this recommendation, ARC places a higher value on the survival benefit of CPR \\n\\ninitiated by laypersons and others for patients in cardiac arrest against the low risk of injury \\n\\nin patients not in cardiac arrest. 21 \\n\\n8.20  Ventilation rates after return of spontaneous circulation  \\n\\nThe requirements for alveolar (minute) ventilation after return of spontaneous circulation \\n\\ndepend on the specific circumstances.

       "Exploration and exploitation are two different approaches in reinforcement learning. Exploration refers to the process of actively seeking out new and unfamiliar states or actions in order to gather more information about the environment. It involves taking actions that may not yield immediate rewards but have the potential to discover new knowledge. On the other hand, exploitation involves utilizing the existing knowledge or information to maximize the rewards or benefits. It focuses on taking actions that are known to be effective based on previous experiences.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the context of the first content, the paper discusses the challenge of sparse reward tasks in reinforcement learning and the need for both exploration and exploitation. It introduces two different approaches: self-imitation learning, which emphasizes exploitation by imitating past good trajectories, and exploration bonuses, which enhance exploration by providing intrinsic rewards for visiting novel states. The Explore-then-Exploit (EE) framework is then proposed, which combines these two approaches to strengthen their effects and achieve superior performance in MuJoCo environments with episodic reward settings. [1]\n",
       "\n",
       "In the context of the second content, the term \"exploit\" is used in a different context. It refers to how enveloped viruses take advantage of the existing routes of membrane traffic to enter and leave host cells. The similarity between viral envelopes and cellular membranes allows viruses to exploit the cellular machinery for their own replication and spread. [2]\n",
       "\n",
       "In the context of the third content, the term \"exploration\" is used in the context of laparoscopic hernia repair. Contralateral exploration refers to the practice of exploring the asymptomatic contralateral inguinal hernia during laparoscopic repair. The study compares the occurrence of contralateral metachronous inguinal hernia (CMIH) in patients who underwent laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) repair with or without contralateral exploration. The results show that simultaneous exploration and repair of the contralateral inguinal region during TEP repair can effectively prevent later CMIH. [3]\n",
