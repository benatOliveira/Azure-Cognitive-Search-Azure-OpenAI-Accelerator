    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer by using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We loaded a vector-based index with large/complex PDFs information , \"cogsrch-index-books-vector\"\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 07**: We used a SQL Agent in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",
    "- **Notebook 08**: We used another ReAct Agent in order to talk to the Bing Search API and create a Bing Chat Clone and implemented callbacks for real-time streaming and tool information\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Obese people: Obese individuals are at a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Obesity can weaken the immune system and increase inflammation, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. Additionally, obesity is often associated with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and respiratory problems, which can further increase the risk of complications from COVID-19. It is important for obese individuals to take extra precautions, such as practicing good hygiene, wearing masks, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Elderly individuals: The elderly population, especially those above the age of 65, are more susceptible to severe illness and complications from COVID-19. Aging weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. Elderly individuals are also more likely to have underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory problems, which can increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19. It is crucial for elderly individuals to follow preventive measures, such as social distancing, wearing masks, and getting vaccinated, to protect themselves from the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that these are general observations and individual experiences may vary. It is always recommended to consult with healthcare professionals for personalized advice and guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: Obese people and elderly individuals are at a higher risk of severe illness and complications from COVID-19 due to weakened immune systems and underlying health conditions. It is important for them to take extra precautions and follow preventive measures to protect themselves from the virus."
