    "As previously discussed in our other notebooks, **harnessing agents and tools is an effective approach**. We aim to leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's large language models (LLM), such as GPT-4 and its successors, to perform the heavy lifting of reasoning and researching on our behalf.\n",

    "There are numerous instances where it is necessary for our Smart Search Engine to have internet access. For instance, we may wish to **enrich an answer with information available on the web**, or **provide users with up-to-date and recent information**, or **finding information on an specific public website**. Regardless of the scenario, we require our engine to base its responses on search results.\n",

    "By the conclusion of this notebook, you'll have a solid understanding of the Bing Search API basics, including **how to create a Web Search Agent using the Bing Search API**, and how these tools can strengthen your chatbot. Additionally, you'll learn about **Callback Handlers, their use, and their significance in bot applications**."
